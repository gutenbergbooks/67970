<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HEN we consider the great extent of the Chinese Empire
and its teeming population&mdash;both of them larger than those
of Europe&mdash;and the fact that a race with a natural gift
for the potter's craft and a deep appreciation of its productions
has lived and laboured there for twenty centuries (to look no
farther back than the Han dynasty), it seems almost presumptuous
to attempt a history of so vast and varied an industry
within the compass of two volumes. Anything approaching
finality in such a subject is out of the question, and, indeed,
imagination staggers at the thought of a complete record of every
pottery started in China in the past and present.</p>

<p>As far as pottery is concerned, we must be content with the
identification of a few prominent types and with very broad classifications,
whether they be chronological or topographical. Indeed,
the potteries named in the Chinese records are only a few of those
which must have existed; and though we may occasionally rejoice
to find in our collections a series like the red stonewares of Yi&ndash;hsing,
which can be definitely located, a very large proportion of our pottery
must be labelled uncertain or unknown. How many experts here
or on the Continent could identify the pottery made in South
Germany or Hungary a hundred years ago? What chance,
then, is there of recognising any but the most celebrated wares
of China?</p>

<p>In dealing with porcelain as distinct from pottery, we have a
simpler proposition. The bulk of what we see in Europe is not
older than the Ming dynasty and was made at one of two large
centres, viz. Ching&ndash;tê Chên in Kiangsi, and Tê&ndash;hua in Fukien.
Topographical arrangement, then, is an easy matter, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
is a considerable amount of information available to guide us in
chronological considerations.</p>

<p>The antiquity of Chinese porcelain, its variety and beauty,
and the wonderful skill of the Chinese craftsmen, accumulated from
the traditions of centuries, have made the study of the potter's art
in China peculiarly absorbing and attractive. There is scope for
every taste in its inexhaustible variety. Compared with it in age,
European porcelain is but a thing of yesterday, a mere two centuries
old, and based from the first on Chinese models. Even the
so&ndash;called European style of decoration which developed at Meissen
and Sèvres, though quite Western in general effect, will be found
on analysis to be composed of Chinese elements. It would be
useless to compare the artistic merits of the Eastern and Western
wares.</p>

<p>It is so much a matter of personal taste. For my own part,
I consider that the decorative genius of the Chinese and their
natural colour sense, added to their long training, have placed them
so far above their European followers that comparison is irrelevant.
Even the commoner sorts of old Chinese porcelain, made for the
export trade, have undeniable decorative qualities, while the specimens
in pure Chinese taste, and particularly the Court wares, are
unsurpassed in quality and finish.</p>

<p>The merits and beauty of porcelain have always been recognised
by the Chinese, who ranked it from the earliest days among their
precious materials. Chinese poets make frequent reference to its
dainty qualities, its jade&ndash;like appearance, its musical ring, its lightness
and refinement. The green cups of Yüeh Chou ware in the
T´ang dynasty were likened to moulded lotus leaves; and the
white Ta&ndash;yi bowls surpassed hoar&ndash;frost and snow. Many stanzas
were inspired by the porcelain bowls used at the tea and wine symposia,
where cultivated guests capped each other's verses. In a
pavilion at Yün&ndash;mên, in the vicinity of Ching&ndash;tê Chên, is a tablet
inscribed, "The white porcelain is quietly passed all through the
night, the fragrant vapour (of the tea) fills the peaceful pavilion,"
an echo of a symposium held there by some distinguished persons in
the year 1101 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, and no doubt alluding to wares of local make.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we read of a drinking&ndash;bout in which the wine bowls
of white Ting Chou porcelain inspired a verse&ndash;capping competition.
"Ting Chou porcelain bowls in colour white throughout the Empire,"
wrote one. Another followed, "Compared with them, glass is a
light and fickle mistress, amber a dull and stupid female slave."
The third proceeded: "The vessel's body is firm and crisp; the
texture of its skin is yet more sleek and pleasing."</p>

<p>The author of the <em>P´ing hua p´u</em>, a late Ming work on flower
vases, exhorts us: "Prize the porcelain and disdain gold and
silver. Esteem pure elegance."</p>

<p>In their admiration of antiques the Chinese yield to none, and
nowhere have private collections been more jealously guarded and
more difficult of access. Even in the sixteenth century relatively
large sums were paid for Sung porcelains, and £30 was not too
much for a "chicken wine cup" barely a hundred years old. The
ownership of a choice antique&mdash;say, of the Sung dynasty&mdash;made
the possessor a man of mark; perhaps even a marked man if the
local ruler chanced to be of a grasping nature.</p>

<p>A story is told on p. 75 of this volume of a Ko ware incense
burner (afterwards sold for 200 ounces of gold), which brought a
man to imprisonment and torture in the early Ming period; and,
if the newspaper account was correct, there was an incident in the
recent revolution which should touch the collector's heart. A
prominent general, who, like so many Chinese grandees, was an
ardent collector, was expecting a choice piece of porcelain from
Shanghai. In due course the box arrived and was taken to the
general's sanctum. He proceeded to open it, no doubt with all
the eagerness and suppressed excitement which collectors feel in
such tense moments, only to be blown to pieces by a bomb! His
enemies had known too well the weak point in his defence.</p>

<p>Collecting is a less dangerous sport in England; but if it were
not so, the ardent collector would be in no way deterred. Warnings
are wasted on him, and he would follow his quarry, even though the
path were strewn with fragments of his indiscreet fellows. Still
less is he discouraged by difficulties of another kind, as illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
'by the story<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of T´ang's white Sung tripod, which was so closely
imitated that its owner, one of the most celebrated collectors of the
sixteenth century, could not distinguish the copy from the original.
An eighteenth century Chinese writer points the moral of the story:
"When connoisseurs point with admiration to a vessel, calling
it Ting ware, or, again, Kuan ware, how can we know that it is not
a 'false tripod' which deceives them?" The force of this question
will be appreciated by collectors of Sung wares, especially of the
white Ting porcelains and the green celadons; for there is nothing
more difficult to classify correctly than these long&ndash;lived types.
There are, however, authentic Sung examples within reach, and
we can train our eyes with these, so that nothing but the very
best imitations will deceive us; and, after all, if we succeed in
obtaining a really first&ndash;rate Ming copy of a Sung type we shall be
fortunate, for if we ever discover the truth&mdash;which is an unlikely
contingency&mdash;we may console ourselves with thoughts of the
enthusiast who eventually bought T´ang's false tripod for £300
and "went home perfectly happy."</p>

<p>In spite of all that has been written in the past on Oriental
ceramics, the study is still young, and it will be long before the
last word is said on the subject. Still our knowledge is constantly
increasing, and remarkable strides have been made in recent years.
The first serious work on Chinese porcelain was Julien's translation
of the <em>Ching&ndash;tê Chên t´ao lu</em>, published in 1856. The work of a
scholar who was not an expert, it was inevitably marred by misunderstanding
of the material, and subsequent writers who followed
blindly were led into innumerable confusions. The Franks Catalogue,
issued in 1876, was one of the first attempts to classify Oriental
wares on some intelligible system; but it was felt that not enough
was known at that time to justify a chronological classification of the
collection, and the somewhat unscientific method of grouping by
colours and processes of decoration was adopted as a convenient
expedient. At the end of last century Dr. S.W. Bushell revolutionised
the study of Chinese porcelain by his <em>Oriental Ceramic Art</em>, a
book, unfortunately, difficult to obtain, and by editing Cosmo Monkhouse's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
excellent <em>History and Description of Chinese Porcelain</em>.
These were followed by the South Kensington Museum Handbook
and by the translation and reproduction of the sixteenth century
Album of Hsiang Yüan&ndash;p´ien, and later by the more important
translation of the <em>T´ao shuo</em>.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to over&ndash;estimate the importance of
Bushell's pioneer work; and I hasten to make the fullest acknowledgment
of the free use I have made of his writings, the more so because
I have not hesitated to criticise freely his translations where necessary.
The Chinese language is notoriously obscure and ambiguous, and
differences of opinion on difficult passages are inevitable. In fact,
I would say that it is unwise to build up theories on any translation
whatsoever without verifying the critical passages in the original.
For this reason I found it necessary to work laboriously through
the available Chinese ceramic literature, a task which would have
been quite impossible with my brief acquaintance with the language
had it not been for the invaluable aid of Dr. Lionel Giles,
who helped me over the difficult ground. I have, moreover, taken
the precaution of giving the Chinese text in all critical passages,
so that the reader may satisfy himself as to their true meaning.</p>

<p>While Dr. Bushell's contributions have greatly simplified the
study of the later Chinese porcelains, little or no account was taken
in the older books of the pottery and early wares. The materials
necessary for the study of these were wanting in Europe. Stray
examples of the coarser types and export wares had found their
way into our collections, but not in sufficient numbers or importance
to arouse any general interest, and the condition of the Western
market for the early types was not such as to tempt the native
collector to part with his rare and valued specimens. In the last
few years the position has completely changed. The opening up of
China and the increased opportunities which Europeans enjoy, not
only for studying the monuments of ancient Chinese art, but for
acquiring examples of the early masterpieces in painting, sculpture,
bronze, jade, and ceramic wares, have given the Western student
a truer insight into the greatness of the earlier phases of Chinese
art, and have awakened a new and widespread enthusiasm for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
An immense quantity of objects, interesting both artistically and
archæologically, has been discovered in the tombs which railway
construction has incidentally opened; and although this rich material
has been gathered haphazard and under the least favourable
conditions for accurate classification, a great deal has been learnt,
and it is not too much to say that the study of early Chinese art
has been completely revolutionised. Numerous collections have
been formed, and the resulting competition has created a market
into which even the treasured specimens of the Chinese collectors
are being lured. Political circumstances have been another factor
of the situation, and the Western collector has profited by the
unhappy conditions which have prevailed in China since the
revolution in 1912.</p>

<p>The result of all this, ceramically speaking, is that we are now
familiar with the pottery of the Han dynasty; the ceramic art of
the T´ang period has been unfolded in wholly unexpected splendour;
the Sung problems no longer consist in reconciling ambiguous Chinese
phrases, but in the classification of actual specimens; the Ming
porcelain is seen in clearer perspective, and our already considerable
information on the wares of the last dynasty has been revised
and supplemented by further studies. So much progress, in fact,
has been made, that it was high time to take stock of the present
position, and to set out the material which has been collected, not,
of course, with any thoughts of finality, but to serve as a basis
for a further forward move. That is the purpose of the present
volumes, in which I have attempted merely to lay before the reader
the existing material for studying Chinese ceramics as I have found
it, adding my own conclusions and comments, which he may or
may not accept.</p>

<p>The most striking additions to our knowledge in recent years,
have without doubt been those which concern the T´ang pottery.
What was previously a blank is now filled with a rich series covering
the whole gamut of ceramic wares, from a soft plaster&ndash;like material
through faïence and stoneware up to true porcelain. The T´ang
potters had little to learn in technical matters. They used the
soft lead glazes, coloured green, blue, amber, and purplish brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
by the same metallic oxides as formed the basis of the cognate
glazes on Ming pottery. They used high&ndash;fired feldspathic glazes,
white, brownish green, chocolate brown, purplish black, and tea&ndash;dust
green, sometimes with frothy splashes of grey or bluish grey,
as on the Sung wares. Sometimes these glazes were superposed as
on the Japanese tea jars, which avowedly owed their technique
to Chinese models. It is evident that streaked and mottled effects
appealed specially to the taste of the time, and marbling both of
the glaze and of the body was practised. Carving designs in low
relief, or incising them with a pointed instrument and filling in the
spaces with coloured glazes, stamping small patterns on the body,
and applying reliefs which had been previously pressed out in
moulds, were methods employed for surface decoration. Painted
designs in unfired pigments appear on some of the tomb wares,
and it is now practically certain that painting in black under
a green glaze was used by the T´ang potters. Moreover, the
existence of porcelain proper in the T´ang period is definitely
established.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of T´ang pottery is the
strong Hellenistic flavour apparent in the shapes of the vessels
and in certain details of the ornament, particularly in the former.
Other foreign influences observable in T´ang art are Persian, Sassanian,
Scytho&ndash;Siberian, and Indian, and one would say that Chinese
art at this period was in a peculiarly receptive state. As compared
with the conventional style of later ages which we have come to
regard as characteristically Chinese, the T´ang art is quite distinctive,
and almost foreign in many of its aspects.</p>

<p>The revelation of T´ang ceramics has provided many surprises,
and doubtless there are more in store for us. There are certainly
many gaps to fill and many apparent anomalies to explain. We
are still in the dark with regard to the potter's art of the four hundred
years which separate the Han and T´ang dynasties. The
Buddhist sculptures of this time reveal a high level of artistic
development, and we may assume that the minor arts, and pottery
among them, were not neglected. When some light is shed from
excavation or otherwise upon this obscure interval, no doubt we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
shall see that we have fixed our boundaries too rigidly, and that
the Han types must be carried forward and the T´ang types carried
back to bridge the gap. Meanwhile, we can only make the best
of the facts which have been revealed at present, keeping our classification
as elastic as possible. Probably the soft lead glazes belong
to the earlier part of the T´ang period and extend back to the Sui
and Wei, linking up with the green glaze of the Han pottery, while
the high&ndash;fired glazes tended to supersede these in the latter part
of the dynasty.</p>

<p>The high&ndash;fired feldspathic glazes seem to have held the field
entirely in the Sung dynasty, and the lead glazes, as far as our
observation goes, do not reappear until the Ming dynasty.</p>

<p>The Sung is the age of high&ndash;fired glazes, splendid in their lavish
richness and in the subtle and often unforeseen tints which emerge
from their opalescent depths. It is also an age of bold, free potting,
robust and virile forms, an age of pottery in its purest manifestation.
Painted ornament was used at certain factories in black
and coloured clays, and, it would seem, even in red and green enamels;
but painted ornament was less esteemed than the true ceramic
decoration obtained by carving, incising, and moulding&mdash;processes
which the potters worked with the clay alone.</p>

<p>If we could rest content with a comprehensive classification of
the Sung wares, as we have had perforce to do in the case of the
T´ang, one of the chief difficulties in this part of our task would
be avoided. But the Chinese have given us a number of important
headings, under which it has become obligatory to try and group
our specimens. Some of these types have been clearly identified,
but there are others which still remain vague and ill&ndash;defined; and
there are many specimens, especially among the coarser kinds of
ware, which cannot be referred to any of the main groups. But the
true collector will not find the difficulties connected with the Sung
wares in any way discouraging. He will revel in them, taking
pleasure in the fact that he has new ground to break, many
riddles to solve, and a subject to master which is worthy of
his steel.</p>

<p>Apparently a coarse form of painting in blue was employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
at one factory at least in the Sung period,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and we may now consider
it practically certain that the first essays in painting both
under and over the glaze go back several centuries earlier than
was previously supposed. Blue and white and polychrome porcelain
chiefly occupied the energies of the Imperial potters at Ching&ndash;tê
Chên in the Ming dynasty, and the classic periods for these types
fall in the fifteenth century. The vogue of the Sung glazes scarcely
survived the brief intermediate dynasty of the Yüan, and we are
told by a Chinese writer<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that "on the advent of the Ming dynasty
the <em>pi sê</em><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> began to disappear." Pictorial ornament and painted
brocade patterns were in favour on the Ming wares; and it will
be observed that as compared with those of the later porcelains
the Ming designs are painted with more freedom and individuality.
In the Ch´ing dynasty the appetite of the Ching&ndash;tê Chên potters
was omnivorous and their skill was supreme. They are not only
noted for certain specialities, such as the K´ang Hsi blue and white
and <em>famille verte</em>, the <em>sang de bœuf</em> and peach&ndash;bloom reds, and for
the development of the <em>famille rose</em> palette, but for the revival of
all the celebrated types of the classic periods of the Sung and Ming;
and when they had exhausted the possibilities of these they turned
to other materials and copied with magical exactitude the ornaments
in metal, carved stone, lacquer, wood, shell, glass&mdash;in a word, every
artistic substance, whether natural or artificial.</p>

<p>The mastery of such a large and complex subject as Oriental
ceramics requires not a little study of history and technique, in
books and in collections. The theory and practice should be taken
simultaneously, for neither can be of much use without the other.
The possession of a few specimens which can be freely handled
and closely studied is an immense advantage. They need not be
costly pieces. In fact, broken fragments will give as much of the
all&ndash;important information on paste and glaze as complete specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
Those who have not the good fortune to possess the latter, will find
ample opportunity for study in the public museums with which
most of the large cities of the world are provided. The traveller
will be directed to these by his "Baedeker," and I shall only
mention a few of the most important museums with which I have
personal acquaintance, and to which I gratefully express my thanks
for invaluable assistance.</p>

<p><em>London.</em>&mdash;The Victoria and Albert Museum possesses the famous
Salting Collection, in which the Ch´ing dynasty porcelains are seen
at their best: besides the collection formed by the Museum itself
and many smaller bequests, gifts, and loans, in which all periods
are represented. The Franks Collection in the British Museum is
one of the best collections for the student because of its catholic
and representative nature.</p>

<p><em>Birmingham</em> and <em>Edinburgh</em> have important collections in their
art galleries, and most of the large towns have some Chinese wares
in their museums.</p>

<p><em>Paris.</em>&mdash;The Grandidier Collection in the Louvre is one of the
largest in the world. The Cernuschi Museum contains many interesting
examples, especially of the early celadons, and the Musée
Guimet and the Sèvres Museum have important collections.</p>

<p><em>Berlin.</em>&mdash;The Kunstgewerbe Museum has a small collection containing
some important specimens. The Hohenzollern Museum and
the Palace of Charlottenburg have historic collections formed chiefly
at the end of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><em>Dresden.</em>&mdash;The famous and historic collection, formed principally
by Augustus the Strong, is exhibited in the Johanneum, and is
especially important for the study of the K´ang Hsi porcelains.
The Stübel Collection in the Kunstgewerbe Museum, too, is of
interest.</p>

<p><em>Gotha.</em>&mdash;The Herzögliches Museum contains an important series
of the Sung and Yüan wares formed by Professor Hirth.</p>

<p><em>Cologne.</em>&mdash;An important and peculiarly well&ndash;arranged museum
of Far&ndash;Eastern art, formed by the late Dr. Adolf Fischer and his
wife, is attached to the Kunstgewerbe Museum.</p>

<p><em>New York.</em>&mdash;The Metropolitan Museum is particularly rich in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
Ming and Ch´ing porcelains. It is fortunate in having the splendid
Pierpont Morgan Collection and the Avery Collection, and when the
Altmann Collection is duly installed in its galleries it will be unrivalled
in the wares of the last dynasty. The Natural History
Museum has a good series of Han pottery.</p>

<p><em>Chicago.</em>&mdash;The Field Museum of Natural History has probably the
largest collection of Han pottery and T´ang figurines in the world.
It has also an interesting series of later Chinese pottery, including
specimens from certain modern factories which are important for
comparative study. These collections were formed by Dr. Laufer
in China. There is also a small collection of the later porcelains in
the Art Institute.</p>

<p><em>Boston.</em>&mdash;The Museum of Fine Arts has a considerable collection
of Chinese porcelain, in which the earlier periods are specially well
represented. The American collections, both public and private,
are especially strong in monochrome porcelains, and in this department
they are much in advance of the European.</p>

<p>To acknowledge individually all the kind attentions I have
received from those in charge of the various museums would
make a long story. They will perhaps forgive me if I thank
them collectively. The private collectors to whom I must express
my gratitude are scarcely less numerous. They have given
me every facility for the study of their collections, and in many
cases, as will be seen in tile list of plates, they have freely assisted
with the illustrations. I am specially indebted to Mr. Eumorfopoulos,
Mr. Alexander, Mr. R. H. Benson, Mr. S. T. Peters, and
Mr. C. L. Freer, who have done so much for the study of the early
wares in England and America. Without the unstinted help of
these enthusiastic collectors it would have been impossible to produce
the first volume of this book. What I owe to Mr. Eumorfopoulos
can be partly guessed from the list of plates. His collection
is an education in itself, and he has allowed me to draw freely
on it and on his own wide experience. Of the many other collectors
who have similarly assisted in various parts of the work, I have to
thank Sir Hercules Read, Mr. S. E. Kennedy, Dr. A. E. Cumberbatch,
Mr. C. L. Rothenstein, Dr. Breuer, Dr. C. Seligmann, M. R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Koechlin, Mr. O. Raphael, Mr. A. E. Hippisley, Hon. Evan Charteris,
Lady Wantage, Mr. Burdett&ndash;Coutts, the late Dr. A. Fischer,
Mr. L. C. Messel, Mr. W. Burton, Col. Goff, Mrs. Halsey, Mrs. Havemeyer,
Rev. G. A. Schneider, and Mrs. Coltart. A portion of the
proofs has been read by Mr. W. Burton. Mr. L. C. Hopkins
has given me frequent help with Chinese texts, and especially in the
reading of seal characters; and my colleague, Dr. Lionel Giles, in
addition to invaluable assistance with the translations, has consented
to look through the proofs of these volumes with a special
view to errors in the Chinese characters. Finally, I have to
thank my chief, Sir Hercules Read, not only for all possible
facilities in the British Museum, but for his sympathetic guidance
in the study of a subject of which he has long been a master.</p>

<p class="p6">THE PRIMITIVE PERIODS</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">P</span>OTTERY, as one of the first necessities of mankind, is among
the earliest of human inventions. In a rude form it is found
with the implements of the late Stone Age, before there is
any evidence of the use of metals, and all attempts to reconstruct
the first stages of its discovery are based on conjecture alone.</p>

<p>We have no knowledge of a Stone Age in China, but it may
be safely assumed that pottery there, as elsewhere, goes back far
into prehistoric times. Its invention is ascribed to the mythical
Shên&ndash;nung, the Triptolemus of China, who is supposed to have
initiated the people in the cultivation of the soil and other necessary
arts of life. Huang Ti, the semi&ndash;legendary yellow emperor,
in whose reign the cyclical system of chronology began (2697 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>),
is said to have appointed "a superintendent of pottery, K´un&ndash;wu,
who made pottery," and it was a commonplace in the oldest Chinese
literature<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that the great and good emperor Yü Ti Shun (2317&ndash;2208
<span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>) "highly esteemed pottery." Indeed, the Han historian
Ssŭ&ndash;ma Ch´ien (163&ndash;85 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>) assures us that Shun himself, before
ascending the throne, "fashioned pottery at Ho&ndash;pin," and, needless
to say, the vessels made at Ho&ndash;pin were "without flaw."</p>

<p>According to the description given in the <em>T´ao shuo</em>, the evolution
of the potter's art in China took the usual course. The first articles
made were cooking vessels; then, "coming to the time of Yü (i.e. Yü
Ti Shun), the different kinds of wine vessels are distinguished by
name, and the sacrificial vessels are gradually becoming complete."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>I should add that the author of the <em>T´ao shuo</em>, after accepting the
earlier references to the art, inconsistently concludes: "I humbly
suggest that the origin of pottery should strictly be placed in the
reign of Yü Ti Shun, and its completion in the Chou dynasty"
(1122&ndash;256 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the writers can throw any light on the
first use of the potter's wheel in China. It is true that, like several
other nations, the Chinese claim for themselves the invention of
that essential implement, but there is no real evidence to illuminate
the question, and even if the wheel was independently discovered
in China, the priority of invention undoubtedly rests with
the Near Eastern nations. Palpable evidence of its use can be
seen on Minoan pottery found in Crete and dating about 3000 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>,
and on Egyptian pottery of the twelfth dynasty (about 2200 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>);
while it is practically certain that it was used in the making of the
Egyptian pottery of the fourth dynasty (about 3200 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>).</p>

<p>So far, the Chinese have nothing tangible to oppose to these
facts earlier than the Chou writings, in which workers with the
wheel (<em>t´ao jên</em>) are distinguished from workers with moulds (<em>fang
jên</em>), the former making cauldrons, basins, colanders, boilers, and
vessels (<em>yü</em>), and the latter moulding the sacrificial vessels named
<em>kuei</em> and <em>tou</em>. We learn that at this time the Chinese potters also
used the compasses and the polishing wheel or lathe. With this
outfit they were able, according to the <em>T´ao shuo</em>, to effect the
"completion" of pottery.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth of this pious statement may be, reflecting
as it does the true Chinese veneration of antiquity, it is certain,
at any rate, that the potter was not without honour at this time:
for we read in the <em>Tso Chuan</em><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that "O&ndash;fu of Yü was the best potter
at the beginning of the Chou dynasty. Wu Wang relied on his
skill for the vessels which he used. He wedded him to a descendant
of his imperial ancestors, and appointed him feudal prince of
Ch´ên."</p>

<p>Examples of these early potteries have been unearthed from
ancient burials from time to time, and the <em>T´ao shuo</em> describes
numerous types from literary sources. But neither the originals,
as far as we know them, nor the verbal descriptions of them, have
anything but an antiquarian interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The art of the Chou dynasty, as expressed in bronze and jade,
is fairly well known from illustrated Chinese and Western works.
It reflects a priestly culture in its hieratic forms and symbolical
ornament. It is majestic and stern, severely disdainful of sentiment
and sensuous appeal. Of the pottery we know little, but
that little shows us a purely utilitarian ware of simple form, unglazed
and almost devoid of ornament.</p>

<p>On Plate 1 are two types which may perhaps be regarded as
favourable examples of Chou pottery. A tripod vessel, almost exactly
similar to Fig. 1, was published by Berthold Laufer,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> who shows
by analogy with bronzes of the period good reasons for its Chou
attribution, which he states is confirmed by Chinese antiquarians.
His example was of hard "gray clay, which on the surface has
assumed a black colour," and it had the surface ornamented with
a hatched pattern similar to that of our illustration. It has been
assumed that this hatched pattern is a sure sign of Chou origin,
and I have no doubt that it was a common decoration at the time.
But its use continued after the Chou period, and it is found on
pottery from a Han tomb in Szechuan, which is now in the British
Museum. It is, in fact, practically the same as the "mat marking"
on the Japanese and Corean pottery taken from the dolmens which
were built over a long period extending from the second century
<span class="smcapa">B. C.</span> to the eighth century <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span></p>

<p>The taste of the time is reflected in a sentence which occurs in
the <em>Kuan&ndash;tzŭ</em>, a work of the fifth century <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>: "Ornamentation
detracts from the merit of pottery."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The words used for ornamentation
are <em>wên ts´ai</em> <img src="images/i_003.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> (lit. pattern, bright colours), and they
seem to imply a knowledge of some means of colouring the ware. As
there is no evidence of the use of glaze before the Han period,
and enamelling in the ordinary ceramic sense is out of the question,
we may perhaps assume that some of the pottery of the Chou
period was painted with unfired pigments, a method certainly in
use in the Han dynasty. There is a vase in the British Museum
of unglazed ware with painted designs in black, red and white
pigments, which has been regarded as of Han period, but may
possibly be earlier (Plate 2, Fig. 3).</p>

<p>In addition to the Chou tripod, Laufer<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> illustrates five specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of pre&ndash;Han pottery, excavated by Mr. Frank H. Chalfant "on
the soil of the ancient city of Lin&ndash;tzŭ in Ch´ing&ndash;chou Fu, Shantung,"
a district which was noted for its pottery as late as the Ming period.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This find included two pitchers, a deep, round bowl, a tazza or
round dish on a high stem, and a brick stamped with the character
<em>Ch´i</em>, all unglazed and of grey earthenware. From this last piece,
and from the fact that Lin&ndash;tzŭ, until it was destroyed in 221 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>,
was the capital of the feudal kingdom of Ch´i, Laufer concluded that
these wares belonged to a period before the Han dynasty (206 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>
to 220 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>).</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>WO centuries of internecine strife between the great feudal
princes culminated in the destruction of the Chou dynasty
and the consolidation of the Chinese states under the
powerful Ch´in emperor Chêng. If this ambitious tyrant is famous
in history for beating back the Hiung&ndash;nu Turks, the wild nomads of
the north who had threatened to overrun the Chou states, and for
building the Great Wall of China as a rampart against these dreaded
invaders, he is far more infamous for the disastrous attempt to burn
all existing books and records, by which, in his overweening pride,
he hoped to wipe out past history and make good to posterity his
arrogant title of Shih Huang Ti or First Emperor. His reign,
however, was short, and his dynasty ended in 206 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span> when his
grandson gave himself up to Liu Pang, of the house of Han, and
was assassinated within a few days of his surrender.</p>

<p>The Han dynasty, which began in 206 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span> and continued till
220 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, united the states of China in a great and prosperous empire
with widely extended boundaries. During this period the Chinese,
who had already come into commercial contact with the kingdoms
of Western Asia, sent expeditions, some peaceful and others warlike,
to Turkestan, Fergana, Bactria, Sogdiana, and Parthia. They even
contemplated an embassy to Rome, but the envoys who reached
the Persian Gulf turned back in fear of the long sea journey round
Arabia, the length and danger of which seem to have been vividly
impressed upon them by persons interested, it is thought, in preventing
their farther progress.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A considerable trade, chiefly in
silks, had been opened up between China and the Roman provinces,
and the Parthians who acted as middlemen had no desire
to bring the two principals into direct communication.</p>

<p>Needless to say, China was not uninfluenced by this contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with the West. The merchants brought back Syrian glass, the
celebrated envoy Chang Ch´ien in the second century <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span> introduced
the culture of the vine from Fergana and the pomegranate from
Parthia, and some years later an armed expedition to Fergana
returned with horses of the famous Nisæan breed. But from the
artistic standpoint the most important event was the official introduction
of Buddhism in 67 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span> at the desire of the Emperor Ming
Ti and the arrival of two Indian monks with the sacred books and
images of Buddha at Lo&ndash;yang. The Buddhist art of India, which
had met and mingled with the Greek on the north&ndash;west frontiers
since Alexander's conquests, now obtained a foothold in China
and began to exert an influence which spread like a wave over
the empire and rolled on to Japan. But this influence had hardly
time to develop before the end of the Han period, and in the meanwhile
we must return to the conditions which existed in China at
the beginning of the dynasty.</p>

<p>The hieratic culture of the Chou, and the traditions of Chou
art with its rigid symbolism and formalised designs, had been
broken in the long struggles which terminated the dynasty and
banned by the iconoclastic aspirations of the tyrant Chêng, and
though partially revived by Han enthusiasts, they were essentially
modified by the new spirit of the age. Berthold Laufer,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in discussing
the jade ornaments of the Chou and Han periods, speaks
of the "impersonal and ethnical character of the art of that age"&mdash;viz.
the Chou. "It was," he continues, "general and communistic;
it applied to everybody in the community in the same form; it
did not spring up from an individual thought, but presented an
ethnical element, a national type. Sentiments move on manifold
lines, and pendulate between numerous degrees of variations. When
sentiment demanded its right and conquered its place in the art of
the Han, the natural consequence was that at the same time when
the individual keynote was sounded in the art motives, also variations
of motives sprang into existence in proportion to the variations of
sentiments. This implies the two new great factors which characterise
the spirit of the Han time&mdash;individualism and variability&mdash;in
poetry, in art, in culture, and life in general. The personal
spirit in taste gradually awakens; it was now possible for everyone
to choose a girdle ornament according to his liking. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
first time we hear of names of artists under the Han&mdash;six painters
under the Western Han, and nine under the Eastern Han; also
of workers in bronze and other craftsmen.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The typical, traditional
objects of antiquity now received a tinge of personality, or even
gave way to new forms; these dissolved into numerous variations,
to express correspondingly numerous shades of sentiment and
to answer the demands of customers of various minds."</p>

<p>Religion has always exerted a powerful influence on art, especially
among primitive peoples, and the religions of China at the
beginning of the Han dynasty were headed by two great schools
of thought&mdash;Confucianism and Taoism. These had absorbed and,
to a great extent, already superseded the elements of primitive
nature worship, which never entirely disappear. Confucianism, however,
being rather a philosophy than a religion, and discouraging
belief in the mystic and supernatural, had comparatively little
influence on art. Taoism, on the other hand, with its worship of
Longevity and its constant questing for the secrets of Immortality,
supplied a host of legends and myths, spirits and demons, sages
and fairies which provided endless motives for poetry, painting
and the decorative arts. The Han emperor Wu Ti was a Taoist
adept, and the story of the visit which he received from Hsi Wang
Mu, the Queen Mother of the West, and of the expeditions which he
sent to find Mount P´êng Lai, one of the sea&ndash;girt hills of the Immortals,
have furnished numerous themes for artists and craftsmen.</p>

<p>It is not yet easy for people in this country to study the monuments
of Han art, but facilities are increasing, and a good impression
of one phase at least may be obtained from reproductions
of the stone carvings in Shantung, executed about the middle of
the Han dynasty, which have been published from rubbings by
Professor E. Chavannes.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> On these monuments historical and
mythological subjects are portrayed in a curious mixture of
imagination and realism.</p>

<p>But these general considerations are leading us rather far afield,
and it remains to see how much or how little of them is reflected
in the pottery of the time.</p>

<p>As far as our present knowledge of the subject permits us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
see, there is nothing in the pre&ndash;Han pottery to attract the collector.
It will only interest him remotely and for antiquarian reasons, and
he will prefer to look at it in museum cases rather than allow it
to cumber his own cabinets. With the Han pottery it is otherwise.
The antiquarian interest, which is by no means to be underestimated,
is now supplemented by æsthetic attractions caught from
the general artistic impetus which stirred the arts of this period
of national greatness. Not that we must expect to find all the
refinements of Han art mirrored in the pottery of the time. Chinese
ceramic art was not yet capable of adequately expressing the refinements
of the painter, jade carver, and bronze worker. But even
with the somewhat coarse material at his disposal the Han potter
was able to show his appreciation of majestic forms and appropriate
ornament, and to translate, when called upon, even the
commonplace objects of daily use into shapes pleasant to the eye.
In a word, the ornamental possibilities of pottery were now realised,
and the elements of an exquisite art may be said to have made their
appearance. From a technical point of view, the most significant
advance was made in the use of glaze. Though supported by negative
evidence only, the theory that the Chinese first made use of glaze
in the Han period is exceedingly plausible.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In the scanty references
to earlier wares in ancient texts no mention of glaze appears, and,
indeed, the severe simplicity of the older pottery is so emphatically
urged that such an embellishment as glaze would seem to have
been almost undesirable. The idea of glazing earthenware, if not
evolved before, would now be naturally suggested to the Chinese
by the pottery of the Western peoples with whom they first made
contact about the beginning of the Han dynasty. Glazes had
been used from high antiquity in Egypt, they are found in the
Persian bricks at Susa and on the Parthian coffins, and they must
have been commonplace on the pottery of Western Asia two hundred
years before our era.</p>

<p>It is possible, of course, that evidence may yet be forthcoming
to carry back the use of glaze in China beyond the limits at present
prescribed, but all we can state with certainty to&ndash;day is that the
oldest known objects on which it appears are those which for full
and sufficient reasons can be assigned to the Han period. To
explain all these reasons would necessitate a long excursion into
archæology which would be out of place here. Many of them can
be found in Berthold Laufer's<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> excellent work on the subject, and
others will in due course be set out in the catalogue of the British
Museum collections. But it would be unfair to ask the reader
to take these conclusions entirely on trust, and some idea of the
evidence is certainly his due.</p>

<p>There are a few specimens of Han pottery inscribed with dates,
such as the vase (Plate 2, Fig. 1) from the Dana Collection, which
is now in the Boston Museum; but in almost every case the inscriptions
have proved to be posthumous and must be regarded at
best as recording the pious opinion of a subsequent owner. It
will be safer, then, to leave inscriptions out of consideration and to
rely on the close analogies which exist between the pottery and the
bronze vessels of the Han period and between the decorative designs
on the pottery and the Han stone sculptures, and, where possible,
on the circumstances in which the vessels have been found. Unfortunately,
the bulk of the Han pottery which has reached Europe in
recent years has passed through traders' hands, and no records have
been kept of its discovery. But there are exceptional cases in which
we have first&ndash;hand evidence of Han tombs explored by Europeans,
and in two instances their contents have been brought direct to the
British Museum. Both these hauls are from the rock&ndash;tombs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Szechuan, the one made by the ill&ndash;fated Lieutenant Brooke, who
was murdered by the Lolos, the other by the Rev. Thomas Torrance,
to whom I shall refer again. The evidence of both finds
is mutually corroborative; it is supported by Han coins found
in the tombs, by inscriptions carved on their doorways, and by
the rare passages of decoration on the objects themselves, which
correspond closely to designs on stone carvings published by
Chavannes. In this way a whole chain of unassailable evidence
has been welded together until, in spite of the remoteness of the
period, we are able to speak with greater confidence about the Han
pottery than about the productions of far more recent times.</p>

<p>The Han pottery is usually of red or slaty grey colour, varying
in hardness from a soft earthenware to something approaching
stoneware, and in texture from that of a brick to the fineness of
delft. These variations are due to the nature of the clay in different
localities and to the degree of heat in which the ware was fired.
No chronological significance can be attached to the variations of
colour, and to place the grey ware earlier than the red is both, unscientific
and patently incorrect. Most of the Szechuan ware is
grey and comparatively soft, while of the specimens sent from
Northern China the majority seem to be of the red clay. Some of
the ware from both parts is unglazed, and in certain cases it has
been washed over with a white clay and even painted with unfired
pigment, chiefly red and black. The bulk of it, however, is glazed,
the typical Han glaze being a translucent greenish yellow, which,
over the red body, produces a colour varying from leaf green to
olive brown, according to the thickness of the glaze and the extent
to which the colour of the underlying body appears through it.
Age and burial have wonderfully affected this green glaze, and in
many cases the surface is encrusted in the process of decay with
iridescent layers of beautiful gold and silver lustre. In other cases
the decay has gone too far, and the glaze has scaled and flaked
off. Another feature which it shares with many of the later glazes
is a minute and almost imperceptible crackle. This feature is
almost universal on the softer Chinese pottery glazes, and has
nothing to do<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with the deliberate and pronounced crackle of
later Chinese porcelain, being purely accidental in its formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The colour of the glaze shows considerable variations, being
sometimes brownish yellow, sometimes deep brown, and occasionally
mottled like that of our mediæval pottery. A passage in
the <em>T´ao shuo</em><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> seems to imply the existence of a black glaze as
well, but it is a solitary literary reference, and it is not perfectly
clear whether a black earthenware or a black glaze is meant. It
was thought at one time that the fine white ware with pale straw&ndash;coloured
or greenish glaze, of which much of the T´ang mortuary
pottery is made, was in use as early as the Han period, but I am
now convinced that this is a later development, and cannot be
included in the ware of the Han dynasty.</p>

<p>Among the technical peculiarities of Han pottery, the marks&mdash;usually
three in number&mdash;of small, oblong rectangular kiln supports
will often be noticed under the base or on the mouth of the
wares. These so&ndash;called "spur&ndash;marks" were made by the supports
or rests on which the ware was placed when in the kiln. In many
cases, too, large drops of glaze have formed on the mouth of the
piece, proving that the vessel was fired in an inverted position,
which directed the down flow of the glaze as it melted towards the
mouth. This is by no means universal. Indeed, the glaze drops
on other pieces are found on the base even when the "spur&ndash;marks"
appear on the mouth. The explanation of these apparently contradictory
phenomena is that to economise space one piece was
sometimes placed on top of another in the kiln.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of Han pottery was accomplished in several
ways: by pressing the ware in moulds with incuse designs, which
produced a low relief on the surface of the pottery; by the use
of stamps or dies<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; and more especially by applying strips of ornament
which had been separately formed in moulds. All these
ornaments were covered by the glaze when glaze was used. Laufer
has made an exhaustive study of Han decoration in his book, and
it will be sufficient here to give a few typical examples.</p>

<p>On Plate 2, Fig. 1 is a green&ndash;glazed vase of typical Han form
with two handles representing rings attached to tiger masks which
are borrowed, like the general form of the piece, from a contemporary
bronze. This vase, formerly in the Dana Collection and now in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Fine Arts Museum at Boston, has a posthumous date<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> incised on the
neck corresponding to the year 133 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span></p>

<p>Fig. 2 is a rare specimen with reddish body and polished black
surface in which are incised designs of birds, dragons and fish, and
bands of vandykes, lozenges and pointed quatrefoil ornaments. It
has the usual mask handles, and stands 16 inches high.</p>

<p>On Plate 3, Fig. 1, is a "hill jar" with brown glaze, standing
on three feet which are moulded with bear forms. On the side is a
frieze in strong relief with hunting scenes of animals, such as the
tiger, boar, monkey, deer, hydra and demon figures, spaced out by
conventional waves. This kind of frieze is frequently found ornamenting
the shoulders of vases such as Fig. 1 of Plate 2, and the animals
are usually represented in vigorous movement, often with fore and
hind legs outstretched in a "flying gallop." The cover is moulded
to suggest mountains rising from sea waves (the sea&ndash;girt isles of the
Taoist Immortals), peopled with animals.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is a green&ndash;glazed box or covered bowl of elegant form, the
cover moulded in low relief with a quatrefoil design surrounded by
a frieze of animals.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 is an incense burner of rare form derived from a bronze.
It is a variation of the more usual "hill censer" (<em>po shan lu</em>) which
has the same body with a cover in the form of hills as on Fig. 1.
In this case the cover suggests a lotus flower in bud, and is surmounted
by a duck. The whole is coated with an iridescent green glaze.</p>

<p>A few choice specimens of green&ndash;glazed Han pottery in the
S.T. Peters Collection includes a well&ndash;modelled duck, a handsome
vase with mask handles and hexagonal base, and a good
example of the "granary urn." The last is a grain jar which
derives its form from a granary tower. In some instances the tiled
roof of the tower is represented by tile&ndash;mouldings on the shoulder;
but in this instance the form is entirely conventionalised into a
cylindrical vase supported by three bear&ndash;shaped feet. The bear,
an emblem of strength, is commonly employed in this capacity
in Han art. Another ornamental form borrowed from a homely
object is the model of a well&ndash;head, of cylindrical shape, with arched
superstructure, in the centre of which a pulley&ndash;wheel is represented.
The well bucket is usually added, resting on the edge of
the well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Plate 4 illustrates a remarkable structure which seems to represent
a fowling tower. Models of houses and shrines have been found
frequently in Han tombs, showing most of the elements which are
combined in this complex ornament. The structure of wooden beams
and galleries and the roofs with their tubular tile&ndash;ridges, the formal
ox&ndash;heads supporting the angles of the lower gallery, the ornamentation
of combed lines, are all features which occur in architectural tomb
ornaments of the Han period. Here we have apparently a sporting
tower, with persons engaged in shooting with crossbows at the
pigeons which tamely perch on the roof. The dead birds have
fallen into the saucer&ndash;like stand below. This rare and curious
specimen is made of green&ndash;glazed pottery, and measures about 30
inches in height.</p>

<p>As already indicated, our knowledge of Han pottery is mainly
derived from the articles disinterred from the tombs of the period,
and this will explain the curious fact that Han pottery was almost
unknown until quite recent times, and that information on the
subject in Chinese ceramic literature is of the most meagre and
least satisfying description. The ancestor&ndash;worshipping Chinese have
always been averse to the systematic exploration of graves. Whatever
their practice may have been when the opportunity occurred
of rifling a grave unobserved, this at any rate has been the avowed
principle. The result is that though China must be honeycombed
with graves and tombs, they have not been overtly disturbed in
any numbers until recent years, when extensive railway cuttings
have opened up the ground. To the progress of railway engineering
the sudden appearance of considerable quantities of mortuary
pottery is chiefly due.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one of our most interesting finds was made
away from the railway in Szechuan. Here, in the neighbourhood
of Ch´êng&ndash;tu and along the banks of the Min, the soft sandstone hills
which line the river had in ancient times been extensively tunnelled
with elaborate chambers protected by small entrance doors. Whether
these were ever used as dwellings is uncertain, but they certainly
became eventually the tenements of the dead. The deposits of
ages have covered over the entrances to these tombs, but from
time to time torrential rain or some other cause exposed their
approaches to the country folk, who invariably pillaged them for
coins and smashed and scattered their less marketable contents.
The Rev. Thomas Torrance, when stationed at Ch´êng&ndash;tu, had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
opportunity of exploring some of these caverns, and even succeeded
in discovering some unrifled tombs, part of the contents
of which he brought over and presented to the British Museum.
The funeral furniture of these tombs varied according to the wealth
and status of the owner. In the poor man's tomb were unprotected
skeletons, small images in a niche, an iron cooking pot, and a few
coins. In the rich man's were terra cotta coffins, encased in ornamented
slabs, images apparently of the members of his household,
a quantity of crockery, and a perfect menagerie of domestic animals
and birds. To quote Mr. Torrance's own words:<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> "Standing with
your reflector in the midst of a large cave, it seems verily an imitation
Noah's Ark."</p>

<p>The practice of burying with the dead the objects which surrounded
him in life has never entirely ceased in any country. Among
primitive peoples it has taken the revolting form of immolating,
or even burying alive, the household of a dead chieftain. Instances
of this practice in China occur as late as the third century b.c.,
and voluntary acts of sacrifice at the tomb are recorded much later
in China as in India. When humaner counsels prevailed figures
of wood, straw and clay were substituted, straw images being suggested
for the purpose by Confucius himself. In the Han dynasty
the tomb of the well&ndash;to&ndash;do was furnished with models of his house,
his shrine, his farmyard, threshing floor, rice&ndash;pounder, his cattle,
sheep, dogs, and poultry, besides his retainers and certain half&ndash;human
creatures which may have been his guardian spirits; it
was provided with vases for wine and grain, models of the stove
and kitchen range with cooking pots and implements&mdash;the last
merely indicated in low relief on the kitchen range&mdash;besides the
more stately sacrificial vessels for wine and incense.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> All these
were modelled in pottery, and must have fostered a flourishing
potter's trade, and given a tremendous impetus to the growth of
modelling and design. The underlying idea of all this was, no
doubt, to provide the spirit of the dead with the means of pursuing
the habits of his lifetime, and the modern practice of supplying
his needs by means of paper models which are transmitted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
spirit world through the medium of fire serves the same purpose
in a more economical fashion. But a fuller note on the grave furniture
of the Han and T´ang periods will be given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Little or nothing is at present known of the potteries in which
the Han wares were made, but we may fairly assume that the
manufacture was very general and that local potteries supplied
local demands. An incidental reference in the <em>T´ao lu</em> gives us
one solitary name, Nan Shan, where the potteries of the Emperor
Wu Ti (140&ndash;85 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>) were situated;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and there is a mention of
potteries in Kiangsi in the place which was afterwards the site
of the celebrated porcelain centre, Ching&ndash;tê Chên.</p>

<p>The interval between the Han and T´ang periods, from 221
to 618 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, is marked by a rapid succession of short&ndash;lived dynasties,
an age of conflict and division, in which China was again split up
into warring states. The conditions were not favourable to the
steady development of the ceramic industry, and little is known of
the pottery of this period. From the few references in Chinese
literature, however, we infer that new kinds of pottery appeared
from time to time, and it is certain that the evolution which
culminated in porcelain made sensible advances. This latter fact is
proved by the scientific analysis of some vases obtained by Dr. Laufer
near Hsi&ndash;an Fu in Shensi. There is a similar vase in the British
Museum with ovoid body strongly marked with wheel&ndash;ridges, short
neck and wide cup&ndash;shaped mouth, and loop handles on the shoulders.
The ware is in appearance a reddish stoneware, and the glaze which
covers the upper part is translucent greenish brown with signs of
crackle. Dr. Laufer's vases are in the Field Museum at Chicago,
where the body and glaze have been analysed by Mr. Nicholls, the
results showing that the body is composed of a kaolin&ndash;like
material (probably a kind of decomposed pegmatite) and is, in
fact, an incipient porcelain, lacking a sufficient grinding of the
material. The glaze is composed of the same material softened
with powdered limestone and coloured with iron oxide. An iron
cooking stove found with these vases has an inscription indicating
by its style a date in the Han dynasty or shortly after it; and the
nature of the pottery, in spite of its coarse grain and dark colour,
which is probably due in part to the presence of iron in the clay,
seems to show that the manufacture of porcelain was not far distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is little doubt that the Han traditions were kept
alive, and the discovery of green glazed ware of Han type in the ruins
of Bazaklik, in Turfan,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> a site which from other indications appears to
belong to the T´ang civilisation, shows that this type, at any rate,
was long&ndash;lived. Two vases from a grave on the Black Rock Hill
in Fu Chou, and now in the British Museum, which are proved
to belong to a period anterior to the seventh century, seem to combine
Han and T´ang characteristics. They are of dark grey stoneware
with a mottled greenish brown glaze, ending considerably
above the base in a wavy line, which is a common feature of T´ang
wares.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that some of the tomb pottery discussed in
the next chapter belongs to the later part of this intermediate
period. Indeed among the pottery figures of this class there are
specimens with slender, graceful bodies and elaborate details of
costume (see Plate 7) which closely resemble the stone statues of
the Northern Wei and the Sui dynasties; but with our present
imperfect information on the tomb finds, it will be more convenient
to treat these nearly related figures as one group.</p>

<p>Turning to Chinese literature, in default of other and more tangible
evidence, we read in the <em>T´ao shuo</em><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of pottery dishes and wine vessels
in the Wei dynasty (220&ndash;264 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), and in the <em>T´ao lu</em> of pottery made
at Kuan Chung, in the district of Hsi&ndash;an Fu, and at Lo&ndash;yang for
Imperial use. The poet P´an Yo, of the Chin dynasty (265&ndash;419
<span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), speaks of "cups of green ware." The actual words used are
<em>p´iao tz´ŭ</em>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of which the former is elsewhere used to describe "the
bright tint of distant, well&ndash;wooded mountains," and as a synonym
for <em>lü</em> (green), though, like the common colour word <em>ch´ing</em>, it is
capable of meaning both blue and green. The ceramic glaze which
most closely corresponds to the description <em>p´iao</em> is the bluish green
celadon best known from Corean wares, but we have not yet sufficient
grounds for assuming the existence of this particular type at such an
early date.</p>

<p>Another poet<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of the same period bids his countrymen, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>selecting cups for tea&ndash;drinking, to choose the ware of Eastern Ou, a
place in the Yüeh territory, and apparently in the neighbourhood
of, if not identical with, the Yüeh Chou, which was celebrated for
its wares in the T´ang dynasty. The period of the "Northern and
Southern Dynasties" provides but two references, to a kind of
wine vessel known as "crane cups" but otherwise unexplained,
and to <em>chün&ndash;ch´ih</em> of fine and coarse ware,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which appear to have
been Buddhist water vases for ceremonial washing, or <em>Kundikâ</em>,
which the Chinese have transcribed in the form <em>Chün&ndash;ch´ih&ndash;ka</em>.</p>

<p>Buddhism was making great strides in China at this time. It
was proclaimed the state religion of the Toba Tartars or Northern Wei,
who ruled the north from 386 to 549 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, and Buddhist thought
and the canons of Buddhist art were now firmly imposed upon the
Chinese. The rock sculptures of this period visited and photographed
by Chavannes show unmistakable traces of the Græco&ndash;Buddhist
art of Gandhara; and in one remarkable instance among
the figures which were sculptured round the entrance of a Buddhist
grotto were deities with a thyrsus like that of Dionysus and a
trident like Poseidon's.</p>

<p>In the annals of the brief Sui dynasty (581&ndash;617 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), we find
that a man named Ho Ch´ou succeeded in exactly imitating a glassy
material called <em>liu li</em> by means of green ware. The exact meaning
of this interesting passage is discussed elsewhere (p. 144), but it is
difficult to imagine any but a porcellanous ware which could satisfy
the conditions implied. Under the circumstance it is not surprising
if theorists see in this green ware (<em>lü tz´ŭ</em>) something in the
nature of the later celadon porcelain.</p>

<p>With reference to the figures of men and animals and the other
objects which were placed in the ancient tombs of China, much
information will be found in Dr. J.J.M. de Groot's <cite>Religious System
of China</cite>. The fundamental idea underlying these burial practices
seems to have been that the soul of the dead was the actual
tenant of the grave; but it is not clear in every case whether the
sepulchral furniture was provided in expectation of a bodily resurrection,
or in the belief that it would minister to the wants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dead in his spiritual existence. Both ideas appear to have obtained
in early times, though it is certain that the second alone explains
the more modern custom of burning either the objects themselves
or paper counterfeits of them at the tomb, and thus
transmitting them through the medium of fire direct to the spirit
world.</p>

<p>The older custom of burying with the dead all that was necessary
for the continuation of the pursuits of his lifetime, dates back
to the farthest limits of history, so that we read without surprise
that in the Chou dynasty (1122&ndash;255 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>) there were placed in
the tomb "three earthen pots with pickled meat, preserved meat,
and sliced food; two earthen jars with must and spirits,"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> besides
"clothes, mirrors, weapons, jade and food pots." It became customary
to hold a preliminary exhibition of the funeral articles at the
dead man's house before removing them to the tomb, and this,
as we may well imagine in a country of ancestor&ndash;worshippers, led
to ostentation and extravagance which legislators of various periods
vainly endeavoured to curtail.</p>

<p>The magnificent burials of the Chin and early Han emperors,
the vast mausolea built by forced labour and stocked with costly
furniture and treasure, chariots and live animals, and even human
victims, must have been an intolerable burden to the community.
There is no lack of instances of the immolation, voluntary or otherwise,
of relatives and retainers at the tombs of great personages
in ancient China, though the practice never seems to have been
general, and was strongly reprobated by Confucius (551&ndash;479 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>).
The sage even went so far as to condemn the substitution of wooden
puppets, "for was there not a danger of their leading to the use
of living victims?"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Images of straw were all that he would
permit.</p>

<p>When humaner influences prevailed, the ladies of the harem,
and the military guards, instead of following their Imperial master
to the spirit world, were condemned to reside within the precincts
of the mausoleum; and doubtless the clay figures of women and
warriors placed in the graves of more enlightened times were intended
to relieve their human prototypes of this irksome duty.
The earliest recorded allusion<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to clay substitutes appears to be
the words of Kuang Wu (in the first century <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), that "anciently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
at every burial of an emperor or king, human images of stoneware
(<em>t´ao jên</em>), implements of earthenware (<em>wa ch´i</em>), wooden cars, and
straw horses were used."</p>

<p>De Groot<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> quotes a long list of objects supplied for an Imperial
burial of the Later Han (25&ndash;220 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), including "eight hampers
of various grains and pease; three earthen pots of three pints,
holding respectively pickled meat, preserved meat, and sliced food;
two earthen liquor jars of three pints, filled with must and spirits;
... one candlestick of earthenware; ... eight goblets, tureens,
pots, square baskets, wine jars; one wash&ndash;basin with a ewer; bells,
... musical instruments, ... arms; nine carriages, and thirty&ndash;six
straw images of men and horses; two cooking stoves, two kettles,
one rice strainer, and twelve caldrons of five pints, all of earthenware;
... ten rice dishes of earthenware, two wine pots of earthenware
holding five pints." The use of earthenware substitutes for
the actual belongings of the dead was due in part to the spirit of
economy preached by certain rulers at this time, and in part to the
feeling that graves containing valueless objects would be safe from
the desecration of the robber.</p>

<p>In addition to the general precepts of economy, we learn that
definite regulations were issued prescribing the number and even
the nature of the articles to be used by the various ranks of the
nobility and by the proletariat. Thus in 682 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span> Kao Tsung
rebuked the competitive extravagance of the people in burial equipments,
which even the ravages of famine had failed to diminish;
and in the K´ai Yüan period an Imperial decree<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the year 741
<span class="smcapa">A. D.</span> reduced the number of implements allowed to the various ranks
in burial, officers of the first, second, and third classes of nobility
being allowed seventy, forty, and twenty implements in place of
ninety, seventy, and forty respectively; while for the common
people fifteen only were permitted. Moreover, all such implements
were to be of plain earthenware (<em>ssŭ wa</em>), wood, gold, silver, copper,
and tin being forbidden.</p>

<p>It is clear that at an early date wood was regarded as preferable
to pottery as a material for sepulchral furniture, for the <em>Yin&ndash;yang
tsa tsu</em>,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> written in the eighth century, states that "houses
and sheds, cars and horses, male and female slaves, horned cattle,
and so forth, are made of wood." Indeed, the decree of 741 notwithstanding,
wood seems to have become the standard material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for grave implements from this time onward. Thus, Chu Hsi of
the Sung dynasty taught in his Ritual of Family Life "the custom
of burying the dead with a good many <em>wooden</em> servants, followers,
and female attendants, all holding in their hands articles for use
and food"; and the contents of the Ming graves included "a
furnace&ndash;kettle and a furnace, both of <em>wood</em>, saucer with stand, pot,
or vase, an earthen wine&ndash;pot, a spittoon, a water basin, an incense
burner, two candlesticks, an incense box, a tea&ndash;cup, a tea&ndash;saucer,
two chopsticks, two spoons, etc., two <em>wooden</em> bowls, twelve <em>wooden</em>
platters, various articles of furniture, including bed, screen, chest,
and couch, all of wood; sixteen musicians, twenty&ndash;four armed
lifeguards, six bearers, ten female attendants; the spirits known
as the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Red Bird, and the Black
Warrior; the two Spirits of the Doorway and ten warriors&mdash;all
<em>made of wood</em> and one foot high." These were among the implements
permitted in the tombs of grandees; the regulations of 1372
allowed only one kind of implement in the tombs of the common
folk.</p>

<p>From the foregoing passages it may be inferred that wood superseded
pottery to a very great extent in the funeral furniture of
the Sung and Ming periods, and consequently that the tombs in
which a full pottery equipment has been found are most probably
not later than the first half of the T´ang dynasty. Needless
to say, the wooden paraphernalia rapidly perished under the
ground, and while the pottery implements have preserved their
original form and appearance, the wooden objects have mostly
disintegrated.</p>

<p>An amusing fragment of folklore, translated by de Groot<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> from
the <em>Kuang i chi</em>, "a work probably written in the tenth century,"
will form a fitting conclusion to this note, revealing as it does the
thought of the Chinese of this period with regard to the burial
customs which we have discussed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"During one of the last generations there lived a man, who
used to travel the country as an itinerant trader in the environs
of the place where his family was settled. Having been accompanied
on one of his excursions for several days by a certain man,
the latter unexpectedly said, 'I am a ghost. Every day and every
night I am obliged to fight and quarrel with the objects buried
in my tomb for the use of my manes, because they oppose my will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
I hope you will not refuse to speak a few words for me, to help
me out of this calamitous state of disorder. What will you do in
this case?' 'If a good result be attainable,' replied the trader,
'I dare undertake anything.' About twilight they came to a large
tomb, located on the left side of the road. Pointing to it, the
ghost said: 'This is my grave. Stand in front of it and exclaim,
"By Imperial Order, behead thy gold and silver subjects, and all
will be over." Hereupon the ghost entered the grave. The pedlar
shouted out the order, and during some moments he heard a noise
like that produced by an executioner's sword. After a while the
ghost came forth from the tomb, his hands filled with several decapitated
men and horses of gold and silver. 'Accept these things,'
he said; 'they will sufficiently ensure your felicity for the whole
of your life; take them as a reward for what you have done for
me.' When our pedlar reached the Western metropolis he was
denounced to the prefect of the district by a detective from Ch´ang&ndash;ngan
city, who held that such antique objects could only have
been obtained from a grave broken open. The man gave the prefect
a veracious account of what had happened, and this magistrate
reported the matter to the higher authorities, who sent it on
to the Throne. Some persons were dispatched to the grave with
the pedlar. They opened the grave, and found therein hundreds
of gold and silver images of men and horses with their heads severed
from their bodies."</p>

<p>In the present day<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> at important sacrifices to ancestors (and
presumably at the funeral itself), it is customary to burn counterfeits
of all kinds of furniture and objects which might be useful
in the spirit&ndash;world. In general these counterfeits take the form
of small square sheets of cheap paper adorned with pictures, stamped
with a rudely carved wooden die, and representing houses, chairs,
implements for cooking, writing and the toilette, carts and horses,
sedan chairs, attendants and servants, slaves (male and female),
cattle, etc. It is not clear when this custom first came into being,
but it evidently replaced an earlier practice of burning real furniture,
clothing, etc., at the tomb; and de Groot implies, at any
rate, that the two practices existed side by side in the eleventh
century. "Bonfires of genuine articles," he says,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "and valuables
continued for a long time to hold a place side by side with bonfires
of counterfeits. We read e.g. that at the demise of the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Shêng Tsung of the Liao dynasty (1030 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>) the departure of the
cortège of death from the palace was marked by a sacrifice, at which
they took clothes, bows and arrows, saddles, bridles, pictures of
horses, of camels, lifeguards, and similar things, which were all
committed to the flames." Marco Polo,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> in describing the city of
Kinsai, relates that the inhabitants burnt their dead, and "threw
into the flames many pieces of cotton paper upon which were
painted representations of male and female servants, horses, camels,
silk wrought with gold, as well as gold and silver money."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="p6">THE T´ANG <img src="images/i_023.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese character" /> DYNASTY, 618&ndash;906 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span></p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE Chinese Empire, reunited by the Sui emperors, reached
the zenith of its power under the world&ndash;famed dynasty of the
T´ang (618-906 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>). A Chinese general penetrated into
Central India and took the capital, Magadha, in 648. Chinese junks
sailed into the Persian Gulf, and the northern boundaries of the
empire extended into Turkestan, where traces of a flourishing civilisation
have been discovered in the sand&ndash;buried cities in the regions
of Turfan and Khotan, recently explored by Sir Aurel Stein and by
a German expedition under Professor Grünwedel. In return, we read
of Arab settlers in Yunnan and in Canton and the coast towns,
and the last of the Sassanids appealed to China for help. A host of
foreign influences must have penetrated the Middle Kingdom at this
time, including those of the Indian, Persian, and Byzantine arts.
Proof of this, if proof were needed, is seen in the wonderful treasures
preserved in the Shoso&ndash;in at Nara in Japan, a temple museum
stocked in the eighth century chiefly with the personal belongings
of the Emperor Shomu, most of which had been sent over from
China. Indeed, the Nara treasure is, in many respects, the most
comprehensive exhibition of T´ang craftsmanship which exists
to-day.</p>

<p>The long period of prosperity enjoyed by China under the T´ang
is famed in history as the golden age of literature and art. The
age which produced the poet Li Po, the painter Wu Tao&ndash;tzŭ, and
the poet&ndash;painter Wang Wei, whose "poems were pictures and
his pictures poems," was indeed an age of giants. It is certain that
the potter's art shared in no small measure the progress of the
period, though at this distance of time we can hardly expect that
many monuments of this fragile art should have survived. Indeed,
it has been the custom of writers in the past to dismiss the T´ang
pottery in a few words, or to disregard it entirely as an unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
quantity Here, however, we have again been well served by the
ancient burial customs of the Chinese, which still held good for
part, at least, of the T´ang period.</p>

<p>The T´ang mortuary wares are similar in intention to those of
the Han, but bespeak a much maturer art. The modelling of the
tomb figures, which have been aptly compared with the Tanagra
statuettes of ancient Greece, displays greater skill, spirit, and delicacy,
and the materials used are more refined and varied. The body
of the ware, which is usually fine as pipeclay, varies in hardness
from soft earthenware, easily scratchable with a knife, to a hard
porcellanous stoneware, and in colour from light grey and pale
rosy buff to white, like plaster&ndash;of&ndash;Paris. The usual covering is a
thin, finely crackled glaze of pale straw colour or light transparent
green, and sometimes the surface has a wash of white clay
between the body and the glaze. Some of the figures, however,
are more richly coated in amber brown and leaf green glazes with
occasional splashes of blue, while on others are found traces of unfired
red and black pigments.</p>

<p>But as the mortuary pottery<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> comprises the largest and most
important group of T´ang wares at present identified, we cannot
do better than consider it first and as a separate class, setting forth
at once the reasons for assigning it to this particular period. As
will be seen in the note to the previous chapter (p. 17), earthenware
appears to have been to a great extent superseded by wood as the
fashionable material for sepulchral furniture towards the end of the
T´ang period. This in itself is strong <em>primâ facie</em> evidence that
the tombs furnished throughout with pottery are not later than the
T´ang dynasty. Another argument of an ethnographical nature is
supplied by the figures of ladies with feet of normal size. The fashion
of cramping the feet, though it may have begun before the T´ang
period, was certainly not universal until the end of this long dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>But there are other cogent reasons which will appeal more
directly to the student of ceramics. Among the few specimens of
pottery in the Nara Collection,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> there are several bowls and a dish,
accorded in the official catalogue the meagre description "China
ware," which have a peculiar glaze of creamy yellow with large, green
mottling, and there is besides a drum&ndash;shaped vase, "green with
yellowish patches." This type of glaze is found on many of the
tomb wares, some of which have amber brown and violet blue
splashes in addition. From these data it is possible to identify
a series of T´ang glazes, including creamy white, straw yellow,
faint green, leaf green, amber and violet blue, all soft and more
or less transparent with minutely crackled texture and closely
analogous to the coloured lead glazes used on our own "Whieldon"
pottery of Staffordshire in the eighteenth century. Three years
ago a Parisian dealer was offering for sale the contents of an important
tomb. For once in a way, the chief articles of the find had been
kept together; at least so it was positively asserted, and there
was nothing improbable in the circumstance. They included two
splendidly modelled figures and a saddled horse in the typical T´ang
ware, with bold washes of green and brown glazes, and with them
was a stone slab engraved with an inscription. I was able to
examine a photograph and a rubbing of this stone, in which excellent
judges could find no sign of spurious work. The inscription
was long and difficult to translate, but the main facts were clear.
It commemorated a princely personage of the name of Wên, whose
style was Shou&ndash;ch´êng, a man of Lo&ndash;yang in Honan, who died at
Ho&ndash;yang Hsien on the 16th day of the first month of the second
year of Yung Shun, viz. 683 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span></p>

<p>Among the T´ang figurines the horse is conspicuous not only
in its comparative frequency, but for the spirit and character with
which it is portrayed. The men of T´ang were clearly great horse
lovers. Their pictorial artists excelled in painting the noble beast,
and the "Hundred Colts" by the celebrated painter Han Kan is a
classic of horse painting. Among the precious fragments of T´ang
pictures on silk which Sir Aurel Stein brought back from his first
expedition in the Taklamakan Desert there were several with
scenes in which horsemen figured. I have compared these with the
tomb figures and found them to tally with wonderful exactitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
not only in pose and style and in the characteristic rendering of
the head and neck, but also in the details of the harness, the saddle
with high arched front and shelving back support, the square
stirrups, bridle and bit and tassel&ndash;like pendant under the mouth.</p>

<p>A complete set of grave goods from a tomb opened by the Lao&ndash;tung
railway near Lao Yang in the Honan Fu have been acquired
by the British Museum through a railway engineer on the spot.
They may be taken as a typical and, I believe, quite reliable, example
of the grave furniture of a T'ang personage of importance. They
include six covered jars of graceful oval form, made of hard white
ware and coated with thin glaze of pale yellowish or faint green
tint, which ends in the characteristic T'ang fashion in a wavy line
several inches above the base. They measure about thirteen inches
in height. These are presumed to have held the six kinds of grain.
Next comes a graceful vase, probably for wine, with ovoid body,
tall, slender neck, with two horizontal bands, a cup&ndash;shaped mouth,
and two high, elegantly carved handles with serpent heads which
bite on to the rim (Plate 14, Fig. 2). The only other vessels were a
circular tray, on which stood a small, squat vase, with trilobe sides,
small mouth, and three rudimentary feet, surrounded by seven
shallow cups. Like the wine vase and covered jars, these have
flat bases, in most cases carefully smoothed and lightly bevelled
at the edge.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The retinue consisted of a charming figure of a lady
on a horse, eight other ladies (probably of the harem) with high,
peaked head&ndash;dress, low&ndash;necked dresses with high waists, and a
shawl over the shoulders and falling down from the arms like two
long sleeves; natural feet are indicated in every case. With these
were two figures of priestly appearance, with long cloaks and hoods,
three other men in distinctive costumes, eleven retainers in civil
costume with peaked head&ndash;gear, long coats with lappets open at
the neck, waist belts, and high boots, their right hands held across
the breast and their left at the side. One of these figures is remarkable
for his foreign features, with exaggerated and pointed nose, suggesting
a Western Asiatic origin. There are, besides, four men,
apparently in armour, and two tall figures who seem to wear cap
helmets with camail falling down the neck and breast armour,
recalling in many ways our own mediæval men&ndash;at&ndash;arms. The
supernatural element is represented by two strange, squatting
quadrupeds with legs like a bull, human heads with large ears and
a single horn which are called by the Chinese <em>t'u kuai</em> or "earth&ndash;spirits."
Finally, in addition to man and super&ndash;man, the animal
world was represented by two saddled horses, two dromedaries,
two pigs, two sheep, a beautifully modelled dog, and a goose. What
more could a man desire in the underworld? All these figures
are of the usual white plaster&ndash;like body, with the pale, straw&ndash;coloured
or greenish glazes which long burial has dissolved into iridescence
where it has not actually caused it to flake away. Some of them
stand on flat, plain bases; others on their own feet and robes. The
latter kind are all hollow beneath, and the quadrupeds have a large
cavity under the belly, a feature common to the T'ang and Han
animals, and one which I have noticed on bronzes of the same periods.
Needless to add, these figures were made in moulds, the seams of
which are still visible.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>A few examples of the tomb figures are illustrated in the adjoining
plates. The tall, slender figure on Plate 7, Fig. 1, seems to represent
a lady of distinction. The elaborate head&ndash;dress and costume,
the necklace and pendant and the belt are all carefully modelled; and
the Elizabethan appearance of the collar is curious and interesting.
The ware is soft and white like pipeclay, though still caked with
the reddish loess clay from which it was exhumed. The style of
this figure with its slender proportions is analogous to that of the
graceful stone sculptures of the Northern Wei period. The genial
monster in white clay and splashed green and yellow glazes
illustrated on Plate 7 is one of the many sphinx&ndash;like creatures
found in the tombs over which they were supposed to exercise a
beneficial influence. Sometimes they have human heads on the
bull body, and they are then described as <em>t'u kuai</em> or earth&ndash;spirits.
In the present example we have a form which strongly resembles
certain Persian or Sassanian monsters in bronze; and it is highly
probable that the idea of this creature came from a western Asiatic
source.</p>

<p>Plate 5 shows a fine example of a horse in coloured glazes, a
fierce figure in warrior's guise, who is, no doubt, one of the Lokapalas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
or Guardians of the Four Quarters in the Buddhist theogony, and a
figure of an actor. The amusements, as well as the serious occupations
of the dead, were provided for in the furniture of the tombs. A whole
troop of mimes in quaint costumes and dramatic poses is shown
in the Field Museum at Chicago, and Plate 6 illustrates three seated
figures of musicians as well as a standing figure holding a dish of
fruit.</p>

<p>A study of the salient features of these and other authenticated
specimens leads naturally to the identification of fresh types, and
so the series grows. For instance, the type of wine vase with serpent
handles is found in glazes of various colours, till of the mottled
T'ang kind, and with slight additions, such as the palmette&ndash;like
ornaments in applied relief on a large example in the British
Museum. These ornaments in their turn appear on bowls and
incense vases often of globular form, like the well&ndash;known Buddhist
begging bowl, but fitted with three legs. Splashed, streaked and
mottled glazes further declare these to be T'ang, and the varying
colour and hardness of their body material give us a deeper insight
into the T'ang ware. All of these show the marks of the wheel,
and many are neatly finished with simple wheel&ndash;made lines and
ridges; stamped ornaments in applied relief are their commonest
form of decoration.</p>

<p>A fine specimen in the British Museum will serve to illustrate
this type of bowl. It has a hard, white body, of typical globular
form, with slightly constricted mouth, three legs with strongly
modelled lion masks on the upper part, and between them pads
of applied relief with lion mask ornaments. The glaze is not of
the mottled kind, but is rather streaked; it is deep, cucumber
green and minutely crackled, and has run down into drops under
the bowl. This fluidity is also the cause of the streakiness of the
colour, which was evidently a characteristic feature of the T'ang
pottery, for it appears unmistakably indicated in a T'ang painting
figured by Sir Aurel Stein.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This painting, a silk banner of
the T'ang period, was found in a walled&ndash;up library at Tun&ndash;huang,
and depicts a standing Buddhist figure carrying a begging bowl
with boldly streaked exterior.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the mottled glazes&mdash;which, by the way, are the
forerunners of the so&ndash;called "tiger&ndash;skin" porcelains of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries&mdash;and the single colours already mentioned,
instances have been identified on the principles already
indicated of wares with a full yellow glaze and a streaky, brownish
yellow. An interesting piece (Plate 8) in the Eumorfopoulos
Collection is covered with a deep violet blue glaze on a fine white
body. Others, again, have a dark chocolate brown glaze on a
reddish buff body, and a rare ewer in the British Museum is
distinguished by a deep olive brown glaze flecked with tea green,
which seems to anticipate by a thousand years the "tea dust"
glazes of the Ch'ien Lung period.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Another variety of T'ang glaze, of which I have seen one
example, was an olive brown with large splashes of a light colour,
a greyish white, but with surface so frosted over by decay that
its original intention remained in doubt. One might say that this
was the father of the Japanese Takatori glazes with deep brown
under&ndash;colour and large patches of frothy white. We may mention
here three remarkable specimens found in a grave with a T'ang
mirror and described in <em>Man</em> in 1901,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which are in the British
Museum. One is an oblate ovoid vase, with small neck and mouth,
of hard, light buff body, coated with a dull greenish black glaze
with minute specks of lighter colour. The others are tea bowls
of hard buff ware with dull brick&ndash;red glaze, not far removed in
colour from the Samian ware of Roman times. No exact Chinese
parallel has yet been found to these three pieces, though something
approaching them is seen in certain bowls in the Eumorfopoulos
collection which have a reddish brown glaze breaking into
black, being apparently of the type associated with the name of
Chien yao,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and which are known in Japan as <em>kaki temmoku</em>. This
early kind of <em>temmoku</em>, which was probably made in Honan, has a
hard whitish body, and the glaze is sometimes flecked with tea green
as well as with golden brown. In some cases, too, a floral design or a
leaf has been impressed or stencilled on the black glaze and appears
in the brown or green colour (Plate 43, Fig. 1). It is said that a
somewhat similar brown <em>temmoku</em> ware was made in Corea as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The survival of the leaf green glaze of Han type has already
been noted. It occurs in Plates 12 and 13.</p>

<p>A pale bluish green glaze, somewhat akin to a later variety
of celadon, appears on a few small bowls and jars which have the
characteristic T'ang finish: I have seen several figures of lions
with a crackled light greenish brown glaze; and a considerable
class of bowls and melon&ndash;shaped vases have been found in Shansi
with a hard buff stoneware body, coated with white slip under a
transparent and almost colourless glaze, the combination producing
a solid white or ivory colour (Plate 11, Fig. 3). These
bowls have been considered by some Chinese authorities to be a
production of the Ta Yi<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> kilns in Szechuan, but as there were factories
in Shansi,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> where wares of this type are reputed to have been
made in T'ang times, it seems more probable that they are of local
make. It should be added that the brown, tea dust, black, celadon
and white glazes are high&ndash;fired and essentially different from the
soft, crackled lead glazes previously described.</p>

<p>Apart from modelling in the round, an art in which we have
seen that the T'ang potters excelled, the decorative ornament of
the pottery hitherto discussed has been confined to applied reliefs.
The processes of carving and engraving come early in the evolution
of the potter's art in China, and we should expect to find in the
T'ang wares some indications of the skill in these methods for which
the Sung potters were so celebrated. Plate 12, Fig. 2, illustrates
the use of engraved ornament under a green glaze, and the piece is
remarkable not only for its elegant design, but for the beautiful lines
of its simple form. A few years ago I saw for the first time one or
two stands and boxes with patterns intricate as brocade work, floral
scrolls, and geometrical designs, engraved with a point, and the spaces
filled in with coloured glazes. They were reputed to be of T'ang
date, and though no further evidence existed to prove that objects
of such advanced technique and mature design really belonged to this
remote period the proposition did not seem an impossible one. The
textiles, inlaid woodwork, and painted lacquer in the Nara collections
have just such designs which at first sight fill one with amazement
at their modern feeling. A piece of brocade of undoubted T'ang
origin, figured by Sir Aurel Stein,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> with floral scrolls worked in silk,
looks like a piece of late Persian embroidery. And is not the art
of the T´ang painters essentially modern in the directness of its
appeal?</p>

<p>The truth is, our knowledge of T´ang pottery has only just
begun, and now that the ware is esteemed in Europe at its proper
worth, the choicer specimens which have been treasured in China
are finding their way westward. Every fresh arrival tells us something
new and surprising, and it only wanted such a piece as Fig. 1,
Plate 10, to establish the identity of the specimens whose T´ang
origin we had before only ventured to conjecture. Here we have
a form of dish which is found among the tomb wares of the T´ang
period, made of the typical T´ang white&ndash;body and finished in characteristic
fashion and decorated with engraved designs of the most
advanced type, filled in with coloured glazes, in addition to bands
of mottling in green and white, and yellow and white. There are,
besides, other specimens of similar make but with simpler, though
scarcely less interesting, design of a mirror&ndash;shaped panel formed
of radiating lotus leaves engraved in the centre with a stork in
white and green, all in a deep violet blue ground. The coloured
glazes used in the T´ang polychrome pottery are light and translucent
lead glazes of the kind which reappears on the Ming and
Ch´ing pottery and porcelain, and, as on the later wares, they
are covered with minute accidental crackle. In their splashed
and mottled varieties they have, as already noted, a resemblance
to the glazes of the eighteenth&ndash;century Whieldon ware of Staffordshire,
and it is interesting to note that the T´ang potters also used
another form of decoration which was much fancied in Staffordshire
about a thousand years later. This is the marbling of the
ware, not merely by mottling the glaze as in Fig. 2 of Plate 9,
or by marbling the surface, but by blending dark and light clays
in the body as in the "solid agate" ware of Staffordshire. It only
remains to prove that painting with a brush was practised by the
T´ang potters, and though one is loath to accept such a revolutionary
idea without positive proof, there is very good reason to think
that such pieces<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> as Fig. 3, Plate 12, belong to the T´ang period.
They have a white pottery body, painted in bold floral scroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
designs in black under a beautiful green glaze. We are getting
used to surprises in connection with T´ang pottery, and probably
in a year's time painted T´ang wares, which are now only accepted
with reserve, will be an established fact which passes without
comment.</p>

<p>Stamped patterns are not uncommon, and we often find small
rings or concentric circles, singly, as in Fig. 1 of Plate 11, or
stamped in clusters of five or seven, forming rosettes<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; or, again,
impressed key fret, as in Fig. 1 of Plate 12, which has a deep leaf
green glaze.</p>

<p>The influence of the Western Asiatic civilisations has been
already mentioned in casual hints, but it appears in concrete form
in the peculiar shape of the ewer on Plate 9. The bird&ndash;headed
vessel is found in Persian pottery of an early date, one example
of which may be seen in the British Museum. Another remarkable
instance of this form was illustrated and discussed by Dr.
Martin in the <em>Burlington Magazine</em>, September, 1912.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It had,
in addition, applied relief ornaments of a kind which we have
already noticed, and Dr. Martin expressed his opinion that both
the form and the ornaments are nearly related to Sassanian metal
work. The fact that the last Sassanid king sought help from China<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
points to intercourse between the two realms, and in any case
the northern trade route through Turkestan into Western Asia
gave ample opportunity for the traffic in Persian and Sassanian
wares. But more remarkable still is the classical spirit displayed
in the piping boy and dancing girl<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> on a wonderful flask in the
Eumorfopoulos Collection (Plate 18, Fig. 2). The Græeco&ndash;Buddhist
influence on early Chinese sculpture has already been remarked, and
several classical designs are commonly pointed out on the T´ang
metal mirrors; but here we have in pottery a figure which might
have been taken from a Herculaneum fresco, surrounded by scroll&ndash;work
worthy of the finest T´ang mirror. The body of the ware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
is whitish pottery, and the beautifully moulded surface is covered
with a brownish green glaze, which, like that of Fig. 1,
Plate 12, is clearly a survival of the Han glaze. Other instances
might be quoted of Græco&ndash;Roman influences reflected in T´ang
wares. There are obvious traces of the "egg and tongue" and
"honeysuckle" patterns in border designs, and the shapes of
vases and ewers often betray a feeling which is more Greek
than Chinese.</p>

<p>Reverting to the engraved T´ang ornament, there is a little
oblong box in the Kunstgewerbe Museum at Berlin with incised
rosettes of prunus blossom form, glazed white and yellow in a green
ground and finished almost with the neatness of Ch´ien Lung porcelain,
but of undoubtedly T´ang origin. The same prunus design
occurs on a typical T´ang bowl, in the Eumorfopoulos Collection,
stencilled white in a green ground. I have postponed reference to
these pieces because of the bearing of the latter on the decoration
of the wonderful figure illustrated in the frontispiece, which will
make a fitting climax to our series of T´ang specimens.</p>

<p>This figure, with its stand, measures 50 inches in height, and
represents one of sixteen Lohan or Arhats, the Buddhist apostles.
Its provenance has been kept discreetly concealed,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
infer that it was taken from a temple or mausoleum, and we know
that there were others with it, two of which were exhibited at the
Musée Cernuschi, in Paris, in June, 1913. This one, however, has
the advantage over the others of being complete with its pottery
stand. The ware is white and comparatively hard; the colourless
glaze on the fleshy parts has acquired a brown stain from the
dripping of the cave moisture, and developed a minute crackle, both
of which features are observable on some of the glazed vases from
T'ang tombs; the pupils of the eyes are black. The draperies, of
which the flowing folds are worthy of the finest classic sculpture,
are glazed with mottled green, the upper robe with brownish yellow,
both of T'ang type, and the latter is patched (in true Buddhist
fashion) with green&ndash;edged bands with white designs resembling
divided prunus blossoms in a yellow ground, in style recalling the
decoration of the bowl previously mentioned. The technique, then,
is that of the T'ang wares, but instead of being made in a mould
like the grave statuettes, this monumental figure is modelled in
the round by an artist worthy to rank with the masters of sculpture
and painting who made the T'ang period famous.</p>

<p>When one looks at the powerful modelling of the head, the
strong features composed in deep contemplation, and the restful
pose of the seated form, one realises that here, at last, we have
the great art which inspired the early Buddhist sculptors of Japan.
It is no conventional deity which sits before us. The features are
so human as to suggest an actual portrait, but for the supernatural
enlargement of the ears in Buddhist fashion. The contracted
brows bespeak deep concentration; the eyes, dreamy yet awake,
look through and past us into the infinite; the nostrils are dilated
in deep breathing; the lips compressed in firm yet compassionate
lines. It is the embodiment of the Buddhist idea of abstraction
and aloofness; yet it lives in every line, the personification of mental
energy in repose. But so rare are examples of this style, that, unless
we turn to painted pictures or frescoes such as have been brought
back by the recent expeditions in Turfan, we must look in the
temples of Japan, not, indeed, for similar Chinese work, but for
the Japanese masterpieces in bronze, wood and lacquer, of the
same period, which avowedly followed the Chinese art. The Yuima
in the Hokkeji nunnery, ascribed to the middle of the eighth century;
the portrait figure of the priest Ryoben (✝ 773) in the Todaiji
monastery, and the portrait figure of Chisho Daishi (✝ 891) in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Onjoji monastery,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> are all conceived in the same grand style, and
bespeak a kindred art.</p>

<p>But high as this figure ranks as sculpture, it is far more remarkable
as pottery. To fire such a mass of material without subsidence
or cracking would tax the capabilities of the best equipped
modern pottery, while the skill displayed in the modelling is probably
unequalled in any known example of ceramic sculpture.
The contemporary grave figures hold a high place in ceramic modelling,
but this statue is as far above the best of them as Dwight's
stoneware bust of Prince Rupert towers above the Staffordshire
figurines. Dwight's masterpiece has long been an object of wonder
and admiration in the ceramic ante&ndash;room in the British Museum,
and, with the help of the National Art Collections Fund and of
several munificent individuals, the British Museum has been able
to acquire this wonderful Chinese figure, which is now exhibited
in the King Edward VII. galleries.</p>

<p>It is too early yet to attempt seriously the classification of the
T´ang wares under their respective factories. Before this is possible
the meagre allusions in Chinese literature must be supplemented
by far fuller information. At present our knowledge of the T´ang
factories is chiefly drawn from casual references in Chinese poetry
and in the Chinese Classic on Tea, the <em>Ch´a Ching</em>, written by Lu Yü
in the middle of the eighth century. From this we gather that
the Yüeh Chou<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> kilns enjoyed a high reputation. An early allusion
to this factory in reference to the "bowls of Eastern Ou" in the
Chin dynasty has already been recorded.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The author of the Tea
Classic tells us that among tea&ndash;drinkers the Yüeh bowls were considered
the best, though there were some who ranked those of
Hsing Chou<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> above them. Lu Yü, however, thought the judgment
of the latter connoisseurs was wrong, because the Hsing
Chou bowls resembled silver while the Yüeh bowls were like jade,
because the Hsing bowls were like snow, the Yüeh like ice, and because
the Hsing ware, being white, made the tea appear red, while
the Yüeh ware, being green (<em>ch´ing</em>), imparted a green (<em>lü</em>) tint
to the tea. The T´ang poet, Lu Kuei&ndash;mêng, further tells us that
the Yüeh bowls "despoiled the thousand peaks of their blue green<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
colour." Yüeh Chou is the modern Shao&ndash;hsing Fu in the province
of Chêkiang. It was celebrated in the tenth century for a special
ware made exclusively for the princes of Wu and Yüeh, of the
Ch´ien family, who reigned at Hung Chou from 907 to 976. This
was the <em>pi sê</em> or "secret colour" ware which was made at Yüeh
Chou until the Southern Sung period (1127&ndash;1279), when the manufacture
was removed to Yü&ndash;yao.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The <em>pi sê</em><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> ware has caused endless
mystification among writers on Chinese porcelain. The name&mdash;which
means literally "secret colour"&mdash;has been taken by some
to imply that the colour was produced by a secret process (the
most natural but not the generally accepted meaning), and by
others that it was a forbidden colour, i.e. only permitted to be
used by the princely patrons of the house of Ch´ien.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The author
of the <em>Ching&ndash;tê Chen t´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> states that "it resembled the Yüeh
ware in form, but surpassed it in purity and brilliance." This is,
however, only the opinion of a nineteenth&ndash;century writer who does
not claim to have seen a specimen of either. A tenth&ndash;century
writer<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> makes use of the vague expression, "the secret colour preserves
the note of the green (<em>ch´ing</em>) ware (<em>tz´ŭ</em>)," which apparently
means that the secret&ndash;colour glaze did not rob the ware of the
musical quality of usual <em>ch´ing</em> ware, implying a difference of some
kind between the <em>pi sê</em> and the <em>ch´ing</em> glaze.</p>

<p>Literary references of this kind are open to so many inferences
that their value is slight without some tangible specimen to help
us to realise their import. This difficulty is greatly increased in
dealing with Chinese descriptions because of the ambiguity of
Chinese colour words, which is discussed elsewhere. But in the
case of Yüeh Chou ware, or at any rate of one kind of it, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
an important clue in another Chinese work. Hsü Ching, who accompanied
the Chinese Ambassador to Corea in 1125, in a description
of the Corean wares, makes the remark that "the rest of them
have a general likeness to the old <em>pi sê</em> ware of Yüeh Chou and the
new Ju Chou ware."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Fortunately, we can speak with considerable
confidence of the Corean wares of this time, many examples
of which have been taken from the tombs of the period. The British
Museum has a fair number of examples, quite enough to show the
typical Corean glaze, a soft grey green celadon of decidedly bluish
tint, a thick smooth glaze often of great delicacy and beauty of
tone.</p>

<p>In view of this the colour of the Yüeh bowls, the blue&ndash;green
of the hills, is easily visualised. But China boasts so many makes
of celadon<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that he would be a bold man who would single out
any one piece and say this is Yüeh ware. Among the numerous
specimens of celadon which have reached Europe from various
sources it is far from improbable that some were baked in the
Yüeh kilns, but at present, alas, we are impotent to identify
them.</p>

<p>The author of the <em>Ching&ndash;tê Chên t´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> places the Hsing Chou
factory at the modern Hsing&ndash;t´ai Hsien, a dependency of Shun&ndash;tê
Fu, in Chihli. Little else is recorded about the white Hsing ware
beyond a general statement in the annals of the T´ang dynasty<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
that the "white ware (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) cups of Nei Ch´iu were used by rich
and poor throughout the empire." Nei Ch´iu, it should be explained,
is identified as a township in the Hsing Chou. We may
add that the ware of both Yüeh Chou and Hsing Chou was used
for "musical cups" by Kuo Tao&ndash;yüan.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> One of the criteria which
the Chinese recognise in distinguishing ordinary pottery from the
finer wares of a porcellanous nature is the note emitted by the ware
when smartly tapped with the finger, and we may fairly infer that
any bowls which were suitable for use as musical chimes would
be of a sonorous, hard fired material if not actually porcelain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Ch´a Ching</em> enumerates five other T´ang factories which
supplied tea bowls, all of them inferior in reputation to the Yüeh
Chou kilns. Ting Chou <img src="images/i_040a.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> in the Hsi&ndash;an Fu,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in Shensi; Wu
Chou <img src="images/i_040b.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> in the Chin&ndash;hua Fu, in Chêkiang; Yo Chou <img src="images/i_040c.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> in
Hunan; Shou Chou <img src="images/i_040d.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> in Kiangnan; and Hung Chou <img src="images/i_040e.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />,
the modern Nan&ndash;ch´ang Fu, in Kiangsi, the district in which is
Ching&ndash;tê Chên, afterwards the ceramic metropolis of China. Of
these wares we have only the meagre information that the Yo
Chou ware was of green (<em>ch´ing</em>) colour; the Shou Chou ware,
yellow; and that the Hung Chou ware was a brownish colour,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
and made the tea appear black. The Hung Chou factory is also
named in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> which tells us that "vessels made
at Hung Chou in Kiangsi are yellowish black in colour." A sixth
factory, apparently of some reputation though not mentioned in
the <em>Ch´a Ching</em>, is named in a poem by Tu Fu, president of the Board
of Works,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> in the T´ang dynasty, who says: "The ware (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) baked
at Ta&ndash;yi is light but strong. It gives out, when struck, a sound
like the plaintive note of the Chin&ndash;ch´êng jade. The white bowls
of your Excellency surpass the frost and snow. In pity hasten
to send one to the pavilion of my studies." Ta&ndash;yi was in the
department of Ch´iung Chou, in Szechuan.</p>

<p>The five brief dynasties which fill the interval between the
T´ang and Sung periods are only known to ceramic history for
two wares, the identity of which remains a matter of conjecture.
The first is the <em>pi sê</em> ware of Yüeh Chou, which has already been
discussed; and the second is the celebrated but intangible Ch´ai
ware. Chinese writers wax poetical over the Ch´ai ware. "Men
of old," says a late Ming writer,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> "described Ch´ai ware as blue
like the sky, brilliant like a mirror, thin like paper, and resonant
like a musical stone." An earlier and less hyperbolical description
of it given in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> states that it was made at Chêng
Chou, in Honan, and named <em>ch´ai</em> by Shin Tsung (of the Posterior
Chou dynasty, who reigned for five years from 954 to 959); that
its colour was sky blue; that it was "rich, refined, and unctuous,"
and had fine crackle&ndash;lines; that in many cases there was coarse
yellow clay on the foot of the wares; and that it was rarely seen
in the writer's time. Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> we read that, according to tradition,
Shih Tsung, on being asked what kind of ware he would require
for palace use, commanded that its colour for the future should
be "the blue of the sky after rain as seen in the rifts of the clouds."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
As early as the sixteenth century the Ch´ai ware had virtually
ceased to exist, and a writer<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> of that time tells us "Ch´ai ware is
no longer to be found. I once saw a fragment of a broken piece
mounted in a girdle&ndash;buckle. Its colour was brilliant, and answered
to the usual description of the ware, but the ware itself was thick."
A century afterwards the ware was nothing more than a tradition,
and later it developed a legendary character. Fragments of it
were said to dazzle the eyes, and when worn on armour to turn
aside missiles in battle.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Chinese writers have been troubled by the apparent inconsistency
of the descriptions, "thin as paper" and "having coarse
yellow clay on the foot." The latter may, however, merely refer
to patches of coarse clay or sand which had served to support the
ware in the kiln, and which had partially adhered to the base, a
thing not uncommon in the earlier manufactures. The expression
has, however, led some later writers<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to identify the Ch´ai ware
with a fairly well&ndash;known type of comparatively soft buff pottery,
coated with a luscious turquoise or pale lavender blue glaze, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
we shall have occasion to discuss later.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Needless to say, there
is no probability of this type being the real Ch´ai. Its comparative
commonness alone puts the supposition out of court, but the
suggestion serves to show that some Chinese thinkers, at any rate,
see the Ch´ai colour in just such glazes as the pale lavender blue
of Plate 88, Fig. 2, which undoubtedly satisfies in many respects
the description "blue of the sky after rain."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the celebrated Ju Chou ware of the Sung
dynasty, which aspired to equal the Ch´ai in colour, was evidently
of the grey green celadon type, with perhaps a tinge of blue like
the early Corean wares.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> We have, then, two theories on the
nature of the Ch´ai glaze: (1) that it was an opalescent, turquoise
glaze, such as is seen on the Chün type of wares; and (2) that
it belonged to the smooth grey green celadon class, with the bluish
tint strongly developed. There may be other theories<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> besides,
but it matters little, as no authentic specimen is known to exist.
In fact, the discussion under the circumstances would have but
little interest were it not for its bearing on some of the Sung wares,
which will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="p6">THE SUNG <img src="images/chap_04.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> DYNASTY, 960&ndash;1279 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span></p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>ITH the Sung dynasty firmly established in 960 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, the
Chinese Empire entered upon a long period of prosperity
rendered glorious by the cultivation of the arts of peace.
It is true that the boundaries of the Empire were contracted
and the Tartar tribes on the north&ndash;west had made good their
independence and remained a constant menace to the frontiers
of China. In 1127 the dam was broken and the desert warriors,
no longer to be kept in check by diplomacy or force, burst upon
Northern China and drove the peace&ndash;loving Sung from their
capital, the modern K´ai&ndash;fêng Fu in Honan. The Emperor Kao
Tsung and his Court fled across the Yangtze to their new capital
at Hang Chou, where the dynasty continued under the name of
the Southern Sung until 1279. The description given by Marco
Polo of Hang Chou, which he considered, even in 1280, to be
"beyond dispute the finest and the noblest city in the world,"
presents a wonderful picture of the refinement and luxury of the
Sung civilisation. The great city had its network of canals and
its twelve thousand stone bridges, its flourishing guilds of craftsmen,
its merchant princes who lived "nicely and delicately as
kings," its three hundred public baths of hot water, its ten
principal markets, its great lake lined with houseboats and barges,
and its streets thronged with carriages. The citizens themselves
were peaceful and orderly, neither wearing arms nor keeping them
in their homes, and their cordiality to foreigners was hardly less
than the good will and friendliness which marked their relations
to one another.</p>

<p>The conditions which produced such a community as this were
ideal for the development of literature and art, and the Sung dynasty
has been described as a prolonged Augustan age for poets, painters,
and art workers of every persuasion. It was, moreover, an age of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
connoisseurs and collectors. Treatises were written on artistic
subjects, encyclopædias were published, and illustrated catalogues
issued by the order of the Emperor and his followers. Among the
best known of these last publications are the <em>Hsüan Ho po ku t´u lu</em>,
"Illustrated discussion of the antiquities in the palace of Hsüan
Ho," and the <em>Ku yü t´u p´u</em>, "Illustrated description of ancient
jade." It is true that modern criticism has seriously impugned
the archæological value of both these classic works. It is said that
ingenious conjectures and reconstructions, based on the reading
of earlier literature, too often take the place of practical archæology
and first&ndash;hand knowledge of the art of the Shang and Chou dynasties.
Sung archæology, in fact, appears to have been in much the same
theoretical condition as the Homeric criticism in Europe before
the days of Schliemann. But for us these works must always have
great interest, if only for the records they preserve of T´ang and
Sung ideas. An excellent, if extreme, instance of the inherent weakness
of Sung archæology is given by Laufer.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In describing certain
objects of the Chou dynasty early writers had been in the habit of
speaking of "grain pattern" and "rush pattern," assuming a
knowledge in their readers which subsequent ages did not possess.
In the Sung period the current ideas with regard to these patterns
were expressed by the illustrator of the Sung edition of the <em>Li Chi</em>
by ornamenting jade discs, in the one case with ears of wheat and
in the other with a clump of rushes. Modern archæologists have
identified the patterns in question on objects found in Chou burials,
the grain pattern being symbolically rendered by a number of small
raised discs, representing either grains of corn or heaps of grain,
and the rush pattern by a kind of matting diaper, geometrically
drawn. This instance serves to illustrate the salient differences
between the Chou and Sung art, the two extremes; the Chou art
is symbolical and geometrical, the Sung impressionist and naturalistic.
The Sung poets and painters<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> communed with Nature in the
wilds and threw into their verse or on to their silks vivid impressions
and ideal conceptions of the natural phenomena. The Chinese
art of after years owes many of its noblest inspirations to Sung
masters, but nowhere are these ideas developed with the same freshness
and power as in the Sung originals.</p>

<p>The Sung dynasty was an age of achievement for the potter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
The ceramic art now took rank beside that of the bronze worker
and jade carver, and it received a great impetus from regular
Imperial patronage. The Ting Chou and Ju Chou factories in the
north worked under Imperial mandate. In the south the pottery
centre in the Ch´ang&ndash;nan district received a new name from the
<em>nien hao</em> of the Emperor Ching Tê (1004&ndash;1007), and developed
into the world&ndash;famed Ching&ndash;tê Chên. In the succeeding century
the Imperial factories at Hang Chou were celebrated for the Kuan
yao or royal ware; and numerous kilns were opened in the eighteen
provinces, successfully following the lead of the Imperial potteries.</p>

<p>Subsequent ages have never ceased to venerate the Sung as
the classic period of Chinese ceramic art, and in the eighteenth
century the Emperor Yung Cheng sent down selected Sung specimens
from the palace collection to be imitated by the Imperial potters
at Ching&ndash;tê Chên. The same sentiment pervades Chinese ceramic
literature. It harks back perpetually to the Sung wares as the
ideal, collectors rave about them, and eulogy of the Ju, Kuan, Ko,
Ting, and Lung&ndash;ch´üan wares has been almost an obsession with
later Chinese writers.</p>

<p>Until recent years the European student has been almost entirely
dependent for his knowledge of the subject on these literary appreciations
or on relatively modern reproductions of the wares. Latterly,
however, the interest aroused among Western collectors in the
earlier wares and their consequently enhanced value have lured
many authentic specimens from China, and our information on
the Sung potteries has considerably expanded. But the difficulties
of classification are still only in part surmounted. Many
important problems remain unsolved, and for the understanding of
several celebrated groups we are still at the mercy of Chinese textbooks
and encyclopædias. Obscurity of phrase, ambiguity of colour
words, quotations from early authorities passed on from writer to
writer with diminishing accuracy, are among the many stumbling&ndash;blocks
which the student of these books must surmount at every
turn. Many of the treatises occur in small encyclopædias and
miscellanies on works of art, which are each merely a corpus of
quotations from similar works of the past. Moreover, an accurate
first&ndash;hand knowledge of the wares themselves does not seem to have
been held essential for the Chinese compiler. It is true that the
same might be said of many of our own art&ndash;manuals, and with
less excuse, for the Chinese can at any rate plead the veneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
for the writers of the past in an ancestor&ndash;worshipping people, whereas
our own shortcomings in this matter are due mainly to commercial
reasons. But if the Chinese manuals are often misleading and
obscure, they are at least brief&mdash;too brief, in many cases, and
assuming a power to read between the lines which no European
student can be expected to possess. The result is that where we
have no actual specimens to help us, there is unlimited scope for
conflicting theories on the meaning of the original text. However,
as our collections grow and guiding specimens arrive, more of
the Chinese descriptions are explained, and working back from the
known to the unknown we are able to penetrate farther into the
obscurities of the subject.</p>

<p>To take a single instance. The well&ndash;known celadon ware, with
strongly built greyish white body, and beautiful smooth, translucent
sea&ndash;green glaze, has been identified beyond all doubt with the
Lung&ndash;ch´üan ware of Chinese books. When we read of the green
porcelain (<em>ch´ing tz´ŭ</em>) bowls with fishes in relief inside or on the
bottom, our thoughts at once turn with confidence to such specimens
as Fig. 3, Plate 21, and we realise that for once we are certain of
the meaning of the elusive colour word <em>ch´ing</em>. In the same way
other phrases here and there can be run to earth; and when we
meet the same descriptive words in other contexts, the key to
their meaning is already in our hands. In this way no little
profit can even now be got from the study of Chinese works, and it
tends to increase steadily, though, of course, one living example is
more instructive than a host of descriptions.</p>

<p>The Sung wares are true children of the potter's craft, made
as they are by the simplest processes, and in the main decorated
only by genuine potter methods. The adventitious aid of the
painter's brush was, it is true, invoked in a few cases, but even then
the pigments used were almost entirely of an earthy nature, and
it is very doubtful if painting in enamels had yet been thought
of. Two years ago enamel&ndash;painting on Sung porcelain would have
been denied in the most uncompromising terms. But the claims
of certain specimens of the Tz´ŭ Chou type, with brick&ndash;red and leaf&ndash;green
enamel on the glaze, to belong to the Sung period have been
so persistently urged that they cannot be entirely ignored. At
present I am unconvinced of their Sung origin; but our knowledge
of T´ang wares has developed with such surprising rapidity that
we must be prepared for similar surprises in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Sung. Meanwhile it would be well to suspend judgment on this
interesting point.</p>

<p>The bulk of the Sung wares, at any rate, and among these the
best of them, were either wholly undecorated&mdash;that is, wholly
dependent on form and glaze, or else ornamented by such methods
as moulding, stamping, application of clay reliefs, carving, or etching
with a fine point. All these processes were applied while the clay
was still unfixed, and the glaze was afterwards added and the
ware finished once and for all in a single firing. It follows, then,
that the glaze must be capable of standing the fierce heat required
to bake the body, and as the Sung bodies are mostly of a high&ndash;fired
porcellanous nature, the glazes used on them were limited to the
refractory kinds composed largely of petuntse or porcelain stone.
It follows also that any impurity, any particle of iron, for instance,
in the clay would make its presence felt in the glaze and influence
the colour of the latter, locally at any rate.</p>

<p>There is a striking contrast between the characteristic coloured
glazes of the Sung and the T'ang periods. The latter are, as a rule,
comparatively soft lead glazes, resembling in their colour, texture,
and their minute crazing the latter glazes on Ming pottery. The
former are thick and hard, and the crackle where it exists is
positive and well defined.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Burton<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> makes some interesting comments on these
high&ndash;fired glazes: "There are certain technical points of great
interest to be drawn from a study of the Sung productions. In
the first place, they prove that the Chinese, from a very early period,
had learnt to fire their pottery at a much higher temperature than
the contemporary potters of the West were using.... A third
point of even greater interest, which seems to have escaped the
notice of every previous writer, is that the method of firing used
by the Chinese naturally produced glazes in which the oxide of
iron and oxide of copper were present in the lowest state of oxidisation;
and this is the explanation of the seeming paradox that the
green glazes, known to us as celadon, and the copper&ndash;red glazes,
were amongst the earliest productions of the Chinese porcelain&ndash;makers,
while in Europe they have been among the latest secrets
to be acquired."</p>

<p>The most important feature of the Sung wares lies in their glaze,
which holds <em>la qualité maîtresse de la céramique</em>, as an enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
French writer has expressed it. Its richness, thickness, lustre,
translucency, and its colour and crackle are the main criteria of
the wares in the eyes of Chinese connoisseurs. <em>Tzŭ jun</em> (rich and
unctuous), <em>hsi ni</em> (fine and glossy), <em>jung</em> (lustrous), <em>t´ung jung</em> (lustrous
throughout or transparent) are among the phrases most constantly
met in their appreciations. A word, too, is usually added
on colour of the body material, which in many cases would appear
to have been of a red or brown tint, iron&ndash;coloured or copper&ndash;coloured.
Not that it is necessary to infer that in every instance the ware
was red or brown throughout. It is a matter of observation that
in many of the early wares the exposed places (usually confined
to the edge of the foot rim or the unglazed base) have assumed
a rusty red colour in the firing, while a flake broken from the glaze
elsewhere reveals a white or greyish white porcelain body within.
This will often explain the seeming inconsistency of the Chinese
descriptions in which the word porcelain is applied to an apparently
dark&ndash;coloured material. At the same time, it is well to
remember that the Chinese words which we translate as porcelain
were far more comprehensive than our own term.</p>

<p>Our speculations on the nature of the Ch´ai ware in a previous
chapter brought us face to face with two main types of glaze, the
thick opalescent glaze of pale lavender or turquoise tint, and the
smooth translucent celadon glaze in which green is the dominant
colour. These types are prominent on the Sung wares, and almost
all the varieties of coloured Sung glazes&mdash;with such obvious
exceptions as black and chocolate brown&mdash;have more or less affinity
to these two. So that if we place the old turquoise<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> glaze at one
end of the series and the green celadon at the other, the rest will
find an intermediate place, with leanings, of course, towards one
or other of the extremes. One of the puzzling features in the study
of the Sung wares is the interrelation of the various makes, such
as the Ju, Kuan, Ko, Lung&ndash;ch´üan, Tung ch´ing and Chün, which
all appear to have had points of mutual resemblance, although
the descriptions of individual specimens differ over a wide range.
If, however, it can be assumed that the same fundamental principles
of manufacture were observed in all these factories, and
that the divergences in the wares arose from local conditions,
such as variety of clays, different conditions of firing and slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
variations in the composition of the glaze, a formula is established
which will cover most of our difficulties. I am assured by no less
an authority on glazes than Mr. W. Burton<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> that this assumption
is perfectly justifiable, and that one and the same glaze might
emerge from the kiln as a celadon green, a grey green, dove grey,
lavender grey, or lavender turquoise under slightly varying conditions
of firing, and according to the presence or absence of an
infinitesimal proportion of iron or copper oxide in the body or
glaze. Even with their empirical methods the old Chinese potters
must have soon discovered the conditions which favoured certain
results, but in the meantime quite a number of apparently different
wares would have emerged from the same factory, and yet, in
spite of local peculiarities, a general relationship might be observed
in productions of different districts. So that when one Chinese
writer compares the Ju ware to the Ch´ai, another the Kuan to
the Ju, another the Ko to the Kuan, and another the Lung&ndash;ch´üan
to the Ko, it is not necessary to assume that these porcelains were
all grass&ndash;green celadons because we happen to know that that colour
was the prevailing tint of the Lung&ndash;ch´üan ware. The Ch´ai and
the Lung&ndash;ch´üan may have been as far apart as lavender and celadon
green, and the chain of relationship linked up by the Chinese writers
still hold firm.</p>

<p>No one but an experienced potter can speak with confidence of
the methods by which the varying colour effects in the Sung glazes
were obtained, but it is quite certain that the Sung potters were
not ignorant of the value of such colouring agents as the oxides
of iron, copper, cobalt, and perhaps even of antimony. Green,
blue, yellow, and brown glazes, which owed their tint to these
minerals, had appeared some centuries before on the T´ang wares.
But to what extent the men of Sung made deliberate use of these
oxides is another question. It is certain, for instance, that the
green celadon owed its colour to the presence of iron oxide, but
whether that was a natural element in the clay of certain districts,
or whether it was introduced in the glaze by the admixture of
ferruginous clay, is not always clear. Again, those bursts of contrasting
colour, usually red, which enrich the opalescent grey and
lavender glazes, are most readily explained by the local presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of copper or iron oxide in an appreciable quantity. No doubt these
effects were at first accidental, but it is certain that observation
and experiment eventually taught the potters to produce them
systematically. Otherwise, how explain the appearance of these
colours in symmetrical splashes? The <em>flambé</em> glazes of the eighteenth
century are known to have been produced by means of copper
oxide, and it is not unreasonable to infer its presence in similar
effects at an early date. But it is equally certain that many of
the changing tints in the thick, uneven, bubbly glazes of the Sung
and Yüan wares are due to opalescence alone. This has been proved
to demonstration by Mr. Burton, who has produced from his kilns
a porcelain glaze with passages of pale lavender, and even flushes
of warm red, by using nothing but a thick, opalescent glaze entirely
innocent of any colouring oxide.</p>

<p>Finally, a word of explanation is needed with regard to the
frequent references to thinly potted specimens among the principal
Sung wares. Almost all of the existing examples are of a thick
and rather heavy type. Not that we would have them thinner, for
much of their charm is due to the massive opulence of the thick
opalescent glaze with its prismatic depths and changing hues. But
the Chinese writers constantly refer to a thinner ware as well as
the thick. Where are these thin and elegant pieces? The suggestion
that, being more fragile, they have by now all perished
has been coldly received as an obvious and easy answer to a difficult
question. But it is reasonable enough, after all, when one
remembers that upwards of a thousand years have passed since
their manufacture. The alternative that they existed only in the
poetical imagination of later Chinese writers is far less probable,
though doubtless account must be taken of the exaggerations indulged
in by men who were describing the ideal wares of a classic
period. "Thin as paper," for instance, must have been a poetic
licence as applied to the Ch´ai ware. I shall not cite the illustrations
in the Album of Hsiang Yüan&ndash;p´ien<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> as proof of the fineness
and trim regularity of the best Sung specimens. Whatever
the value of this manuscript may originally have been, no reliance
can be placed on the illustrations as reproduced in <em>Porcelain of
Different Dynasties</em>.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The original was unfortunately destroyed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
fire in 1888, and what we have now is, at best, the reproduction of
a copy, and probably that of a copy of a copy. It is quite possible
that the thinner Sung wares are still represented in Chinese collections,
rare though they must of necessity be. But I believe
that even our own collections are capable of supplying proof that,
making reasonable allowance for verbal exaggeration, the Sung
potters did make wares which could fairly be described as thin.
Many of the white Ting wares are thin enough to be translucent; no
one questions the correctness of the description as applied to them.
It only wants one specimen to prove the case for the celadon glazes,
and that may be seen in the beautiful bowl in Mr. Alexander's
loan collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum (Plate 16).
As for the Ju and Kuan ware, it is useless to consider their case
until we are quite satisfied that we have established their identity;
and in the nature of things the opalescent glazes and those described
as "thick as massed lard" by the Chinese can only have
accompanied a relatively thin body. On the other hand, many
of the Corean celadons are of unimpeachable thinness, and as
they were contemporary with the Sung porcelains and were almost
certainly copied from them, there seems no real ground to withhold
belief entirely from the Chinese statements with regard to the
thinness of certain coloured Sung wares.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Ju yao</em> <img src="images/chap_05.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese characters" /></p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HOUGH no authenticated example of Ju ware is known in
Europe, it is impossible to ignore a factory whose productions
were unanimously acclaimed by Chinese writers as the
cream of the Sung wares. Its place of origin, Ju Chou, in the
province of Honan, lies in the very district which was celebrated
in a previous reign for the Ch´ai pottery, and it is probable that
the Ju factories continued the traditions of this mysterious ware.
Nothing, however, is known of them until they received the Imperial
command to supply a <em>ch´ing</em> (blue or green) porcelain to take
the place of the white Ting Chou porcelain which had fallen into
temporary disfavour on account of certain blemishes. This event,
which took place towards the end of the Northern Sung period (960&ndash;1127
<span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), implies that whatever had been their past history, the
Ju Chou factories were at this period pre&ndash;eminent for the beauty
of their <em>ch´ing</em> porcelain. It would appear from the <em>Ch´ing po tsa
chih</em>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which was written in 1193, that the Ju Chou potters were
set to work in the "forbidden precincts of the Palace," and that
selected pieces only were offered for Imperial use, the rejected
specimens being offered for sale. Even at the end of the twelfth
century we are assured that it was very difficult to obtain examples
of the ware.</p>

<p>From the various accounts on which we have to depend for
our conception of the ware, it is clear that the body was of a dark
colour.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The glaze was thick and of a colour variously described
as "approaching the blue of the sky after rain" (i.e. like the Ch´ai
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ware), pale blue or green,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and "egg white"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> which seems to
imply a white ware with a faint greenish tinge. The author of
the <em>Ch'ing pi tsang</em>,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> a work of considerable repute published in
1595, gives a first&ndash;hand description of the ware: "Ju yao I have
seen. Its colour is 'egg white' and its glaze is lustrous and thick
like massed lard. In the glaze appear faint 'palm eye' markings
like crabs' claws.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Specimens with sesamum designs (lit.
flowers), finely and minutely engraved on the bottom, are genuine.
As compared with Kuan yao in material and make, it is more rich
and unctuous (<em>tzŭ jun</em>)." Two mysterious peculiarities have been
attributed to the Ju ware, viz. that powdered cornaline was mixed
with the glaze, and that a row of nail heads was sometimes found
under the base. The first has been taken as merely an imaginative
explanation of the lustre of the glaze, but it is certain that some kind
of pulverised quartz&ndash;like stone was used in the composition of later
glazes, such as the "ruby red" (see vol. ii., p. 123). The second,
which has been seriously interpreted to mean that actual metal
nails were found protruding from the glaze (a physical impossibility,
as the metal would inevitably have melted in the kiln), is
probably due to a misunderstanding of a difficult Chinese phrase,
<em>chêng ting</em>,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> which may mean "engraved with a point" or "cut
nails." The former seems to satisfy the requirements of the case,
though it would be possible to render the sentence, "having sesamum
flowers on the bottom and fine small nails," referring to the
little projections often found on the bottom of dishes which have
been supported in the kiln on pointed rests or "spurs."</p>

<p>In the list of porcelains made at the Imperial potteries about
the year 1730<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> we read of imitations of Ju ware from specimens
sent down from the Imperial collections. These imitations had
in one case an uncrackled glaze on a copper&ndash;coloured body, and
in the other a glaze with crackle like fish roe; and we may fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
infer that the originals had the same peculiarities. A reputed
specimen<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> of modern Ju glaze<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> has a pale greyish green tint, with
just a suspicion of blue, and would answer fairly well to the
description <em>tan ch´ing</em> or <em>fên ch´ing</em>.</p>

<p>But probably our safest clue to the appearance of Ju ware is
to be found in the important passage already mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in which
a Sung writer describes the Corean wares as in general appearance
like the old <em>pi&ndash;sê</em> ware of Yüeh Chou and the <em>new</em> Ju Chou
ware. The typical Corean wares of this time are not uncommon,
and their glaze&mdash;a soft grey green or greenish grey, with a more
or less obvious tinge of blue&mdash;would satisfy the Chinese phrases,
<em>tan ch´ing</em> and <em>fên ch´ing</em>, and in the bluer specimens might, by a
stretch of poetic phrase, even be likened to the sky after rain.
The "egg white," however, must have been a somewhat paler
tint if the expression can be taken in any literal sense.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations we may conclude that the
Ju porcelain was a beautiful ware of celadon type, varying in tint
from a very pale green to a bluish green.</p>

<p>Though it is nowhere definitely stated how long the Ju Chou
factories retained their supremacy, it is tolerably clear from Hsü
Ching's reference in 1125, or very soon after, to the "modern
porcelain of Ju Chou," that they came into prominence towards
the end of the Northern Sung period, perhaps in the last half of
the eleventh century; and as we have no further information
about them, we may perhaps infer that they sank into obscurity
when the Sung emperors were driven from the North of China
by the invading Tartars in 1127. In any case, the Ju ware seems
to have become as extinct as the Ch´ai by the end of the Ming
dynasty. Hsiang Yüan&ndash;p´ien, late in the sixteenth century, states
that "Ju yao vessels are disappearing. The very few which exist
are almost all dishes, cups, and the like, and many of these are
damaged and imperfect."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> A few years later another writer<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
declares that the Ch´ai and Ju porcelains had ceased to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Ju Chou had the monopoly of the
particular kind of <em>ch´ing</em> ware in which its factories excelled. A
number of other and not distant potteries were engaged in a similar
manufacture, though with less conspicuous success. We read,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
for instance, that "it was made in the districts of T´ang, Têng,
and Yao on the north of the (Yellow) River, though the productions
of Ju Chou were the best."</p>

<p>It has been already remarked that we possess no authenticated
example of Ju porcelain. Doubtless there are many pieces which
are tentatively assigned to Ju Chou by hopeful owners. But it
must be confessed that the few which have hitherto been published
as such are singularly unfortunate choices. Dr. B. Laufer, for
instance, in his excellent work on jade,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> incidentally figures two
vases for divining rods of a well&ndash;known form, of which he hazards
the remark "that both have presumably been made in the kilns
of Ju&ndash;chou."</p>

<p>Dr. Laufer does not claim to have made a particular study
of Chinese ceramics apart from the Han pottery, but if these pieces
are Ju yao, then Ju yao, so far from having been extinct for some
centuries, is a comparatively common ware. Another instance is
the "funeral vase," now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, published<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
by its former owner, Dr. Bushell, as a specimen of Ju ware,
mainly, I suppose, on the strength of the description, "Kuan Yin
vase of Ju Yao," engraved on the stand by the Chinese collector<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
through whose hands it had previously passed. This form of
certificate is always open to doubt, and had it really been a specimen
of undoubted Ju yao, it is most improbable that the Chinese would
have allowed it at that time to pass into foreign hands.</p>

<p>But a glance at the piece itself is sufficient to dispel all illusions
on that point. So far from excelling other Sung wares, this piece
is decidedly inferior in every detail to the most ordinary Sung
specimens. It has a coarse, sandy, greyish buff body and impure
greyish green tinge, such as appears on some of the early funeral
wares which make no pretence to finished workmanship. The
ornament consists of applied reliefs perfunctorily moulded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
though its archæological interest is considerable, and, like almost
all Chinese wares, it possesses a certain charm, any attempt to
place it on a high artistic plane can only end in a <em>reductio ad
absurdum</em>.</p>

<p>Many other examples of this ware have since arrived in Europe,
and they all belong to the same type. Some, however, appear to
be later than the others, having reliefs of white porcelain instead
of the usual pottery. They are always described as "funeral
vases" by the Chinese, and it is exceedingly probable that the
description is correct. The subjects of the reliefs are always of a
hieratic kind, including such figures as the dragon of the East,
the tiger of the West, the tortoise of the North, and the red bird
of the South, the sun disc, and a ring of indistinguishable figures,
perhaps Buddhist deities. There is no reason why such a type
of sepulchral vase may not have been in use for many centuries,
and if the porcelain reliefs in one specimen suggest a date no earlier
than the Ming dynasty, the glaze in another has strong analogies
to some of the rougher T´ang wares. The majority of these vases
are of coarse, rough make; others are superior in finish and
of comparatively attractive form. A good example, belonging
to Mr. R.H. Benson, is shown on Plate 14. It is of dense grey
stoneware, with opaque greenish grey glaze, with a balustrade
supported by four figures on the shoulder, and a dragon and a
figure on a tiger (perhaps representing the mythical Fêng Kan),
besides some small figures with indistinct attributes on the neck.
The height is 20 inches.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible that some of these represent the coarser
makes of the T´ang, Têng, and Yao districts (see p. 55), and that
the attribution of the Bushell vase by Liu Yen&ndash;t´ing may refer to
a lower quality of Ju yao which included these wares, or may
be even the wares made at Ju Chou before or after its period of
Imperial patronage.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>My own conception of the Ju yao is most nearly realised by
the lovely but sadly damaged bowl in the Alexander Collection
lately in the Loan Court at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Its
peculiar form is difficult to reproduce by photographic means, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Fig. 1 of Plate 16 gives a fair idea of it. The colour is precisely
that of the most beautiful bluish green Corean bowls, but the usual
Corean finish and the sand marks on the base are absent, and the
glaze is broken by a large, irregular crackle. Surely this cannot
be far removed from the "secret colour" of the Yüeh ware and
the <em>fên ch´ing</em> of the Ju?</p>

<p>Another specimen of reputed Ju ware is an exquisite peach&ndash;shaped
brush&ndash;washer or cup in the Eumorfopoulos Collection (Plate
15, Fig. 1). It has a dark&ndash;coloured body and a beautiful smooth
glaze of pale greenish grey tint, and whatever its origin, it is
certainly a refined and beautiful example of the potter's art.</p>


<h5><em>Kuan yao</em> <img src="images/i_059a.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese characters" /></h5>

<p>This ware is only second in importance to the Ju yao, and its
exact nature is scarcely less speculative. The name, which means
"official" or "Imperial" ware, seems to have been first applied
to the porcelains made for Imperial use at the Northern Sung
capital, the modern K´ai&ndash;fêng Fu, in Honan. The factory was
established at the command of the Emperor Hui Tsung in the
Chêng Ho period (1111&ndash;1117), according to the earliest<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> or in the
preceding Ta Kuan period (1107&ndash;1110), according to a later<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> account.
Its career, however, was interrupted by the flight of the Sung Court
south of the Yangtze in 1127, though it is probable that a number
of the potters followed the Court. At any rate, the traditions of
the original factory were continued at the new capital, Hang Chou,
by an official named Shao Ch´êng&ndash;shang, who set up kilns in the
Imperial precincts, in the department called <em>Hsiu net ssŭ</em>. Another
writer locates this factory under the Phœnix Hill. Shortly afterwards
a new pottery was started "below the suburban altar" at
Hang Chou, which copied the forms of the older Kuan ware, but
without equalling its quality. We have then no fewer than three
different makes all included in the name of Kuan yao, all following
one tradition but differing, as we shall see, in material and quality.</p>

<p>The first is the K´ai&ndash;fêng Fu variety. The earlier writers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the <em>Cho kêng lu</em> and <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> make no attempt to differentiate<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
this porcelain from the later Kuan yao, but we find in a sixteenth&ndash;century
collection of miscellanies, the <em>Liu ch´ing jih cha</em>, the following
scrap of information: that "specimens (of the K´ai&ndash;fêng ware)
with streaky colour, white on the upper part and thin as paper,
were inferior to Ju ware"; and the more modern <em>T´ao lu</em> informs
us that the K´ai&ndash;fêng Kuan ware was made of fine unctuous
material with thin body, the colour of the glaze being <em>ch´ing</em> (blue
or green) with a tinge of pale red (<em>fên hung</em>) and of varying depth
of tone. It is further stated that in the Ta Kuan period moon
white or <em>clair de lune</em> (<em>yüeh pai</em>), pale green or blue (<em>fên ch´ing</em>)
and deep green (<em>ta lü</em>) glazes were esteemed, whereas in the Chêng
Ho period only the <em>ch´ing</em> colour in varying depth of tone was
used. Moreover, the glaze had "crab's claw crackle," and the
vessels had a "red&ndash;brown mouth and iron foot." The latter phrase
(explained below) is not consistent with the account in the <em>Liu
ch´ing jih cha</em>, "white on the upper part," which certainly implies
a light&ndash;coloured clay, but I confess that I have little confidence
in the subtle distinctions of the <em>T´ao lu</em> in this passage. They are
mere assertions, without any reasons given, and it is not difficult
to find a source from which they may in part, at least, have been
derived, and which in itself guarantees no such differentiation.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
It is likely enough that the K´ai&ndash;fêng ware differed in body from
the red ware of Hang Chou, but it is not likely to have differed
very greatly in other respects, seeing that the southern variety
continued the traditions of the northern, and that the earliest
authorities do not trouble to distinguish the two wares at all.</p>

<p>Another critic,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> discussing Kuan ware as a whole, makes its
characteristics practically the same as those of the Ko ware, to
which we shall come next, and states that "in regard to colour,
in both cases the pale ch´ing (<em>fên ch´ing</em>) specimens are the best,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the 'pale white' (<em>tan pai</em><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>) are second, while those with ash&ndash;coloured
(<em>hui sê</em>) glaze are very inferior." From the same writer we gather
that artificial staining of the crackle was employed on both Kuan
and Ko wares, for he speaks of "ice&ndash;crackle with lines red as eel's
blood" and "plum&ndash;blossom<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> crackle with ink&ndash;coloured lines,"
besides an inferior type of crackle with fine lines which did not
suggest any particular pattern.</p>

<p>The Hang Chou Kuan ware, variously described as <em>Kuan yao</em>,
<em>Hsiu nei ssŭ yao</em>, <em>Nei yao</em>, and <em>Shao yao</em> from the locality of the factory
and the name of its manager, is described in both the <em>Cho kêng lu</em>
and the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>. In the former it was said to be a <em>ch´ing</em>
ware, "finely levigated clay<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> is the rule, and it is of very exquisite
make; the coloured glaze is translucent<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>; it is the delight of the
age."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The latter,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> which makes no mention of an earlier Kuan
ware, gives the following description of the <em>Nei yao</em>: "The material
is fine and unctuous, the colour <em>ch´ing</em> with a flush of pale red
(<em>tai fên hung</em>) and of varying intensity. Specimens with crab's&ndash;claw
crackle, brown mouth, and iron foot, and of good colour rank
with Ju yao. There are, besides, specimens with a black body
which are called <em>wu ni yao</em>. All the imitations which are made
at Lung&ndash;ch´üan are without crackle."</p>

<p>Further information is given in the <em>Po wu yao lan</em>, viz. that the
clay used at the factory below the Phœnix Hill at Hang Chou for
making Kuan yao was of reddish brown (<em>tzŭ</em>) colour, and that this
explains the phenomenon of the "brown mouth and iron foot"<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>;
for "the brown mouth is due to the fact that the vessel's mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
points upwards and the glaze flows downwards and is thinner at
the mouth than on the rest of the body, so that the brown colour
(of the clay) is disclosed at the mouth." The iron foot is, of course,
the raw edge of the clay which appears at the foot rim. As this
peculiarity is not noted in the <em>Cho kêng lu</em>, we are at liberty to
infer that it was not a constant feature of the Kuan wares, and
that some of them, as already hinted in the quotation from the
<em>Liu ch´ing jih cha</em>, had a whitish body.</p>

<p>Of the third Kuan yao made "below the suburban altar" at
a slightly later date, we know nothing except that it followed the
style of the older wares, but with inferior results.</p>

<p>Though we do not pretend to attach much weight to the illustrations
in Hsiang's Album, the descriptions in the accompanying
text cannot be ignored. They include ten specimens of Kuan yao,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
five of which are explained as <em>fên ch´ing</em> (pale blue or green). Of
the rest one is "pale <em>ch´ing</em> clear and lustrous like a sapphire blue
jewel,"<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> evidently with a decidedly blue tinge; another is "kingfisher,
blue as the clear blue sky,"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> recalling the Ch´ai "blue of the
sky after rain "; another is "sky blue" (<em>t´ien ch´ing</em>); another
"onion green" (<em>ch´ing ts´ung</em>), the colour of onion sprouts; and
another is "egg green" (<em>luan ch´ing</em>), which recalls and perhaps
explains the <em>luan pai</em> (egg white) of the Ju yao.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the various Sung and Yüan wares with more or less
opalescent glazes which have reached Europe in recent years, it
is possible to differentiate a considerable group whose characteristics
seem to point to the Kuan yao. Their body is usually of fine grain,
whitish colour and porcellanous texture, but assuming a rusty
brownish tint in the exposed parts. It is, in fact, very much finer
than the Yüan wares, usually so called, and all but the choicest
wares of Chün type (see ch. ix.). The glaze, too, though generally
opalescent, shows marked differences from that of the Chün and
Yüan pieces. It is smooth and even instead of being lumpy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
irregular, and it ends close up to the foot rim in a comparatively
regular line instead of ending short of the base in a thick roll or
in heavy drops. And the base instead of being quite bare or
covered with a brown glaze, has a patch of the surface glaze
underneath. The colours of this glaze show wide variations from
a deep brownish green, which suggest the <em>ta lü</em>, to pale dove
grey (<em>fên ch´ing</em>) and pale lavender blue tints, which approximate
to the Chinese <em>t´ien ch´ing</em> or sky blue, though perhaps not so closely
as does the so&ndash;called "old turquoise." Some of these glazes, especially
the pale lavender and dove greys, are broken by passages of red
or crimson, which in turn shade off into green and brown tints.
Although the expression <em>tai fên hung</em> in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em><a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> has
already been rendered in its most natural sense, "with a tinge
of red," we should perhaps mention a possible alternative which
might make it refer to these very passages of red colour; and the
fact that they sometimes assume fantastic shapes will explain why
the Chinese saw in them "butterflies, birds, fish, unicorns, and
leopards."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> On the other hand, it is clear that these passages of
red are not always accidental, for they sometimes take symmetrical
forms, and it is quite possible that even the bird and fish forms
may have been roughly designed in the colouring medium.</p>

<p>Plate 17 will serve to illustrate this group of possible Kuan
wares. Another example is a dish in the British Museum which has
a whitish porcellanous body and a slightly crackled pale lavender grey
glaze of singular beauty. Other specimens in the same collection
include a small tea bowl with misty grey glaze of the <em>fên ch´ing</em>
type, smooth and uncrackled, and a body which appears deep
reddish brown at the foot; and a small bottle&ndash;shaped vase, with
lobed body of melon shape, which, though of doubtful antiquity,
answers closely to the Chinese descriptions. It has a dark&ndash;coloured
but well levigated body, deep brown at the foot, and showing a
brown tinge where the glaze has run thin at the lip, and the colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is a pale bluish grey with rosy tinges where the body colour is able
to penetrate the semi&ndash;translucent glaze. Another doubtful specimen,
with very similar characteristics, was figured by me in the
<em>Burlington Magazine</em> some years ago.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Since the genuine Sung specimens were sent to the Imperial
factories to be closely copied (about 1730), it might be supposed
that the relatively modern imitations would supply some clue to
the original types. There are one or two examples of eighteenth&ndash;century
copies of Kuan ware in the British Museum on which the
glaze is definitely lavender blue in tint, with a crackle which in
one case is wide and emphasised by blackened lines, and in the
other of a finer mesh.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The natural tendency, however, of modern
imitative wares is to exaggerate some characteristic which this
or that potter might imagine to be specially important, and as
it is impossible to say in many cases exactly when the piece in
question was made, we cannot be sure how far the potters in each
case may have strayed from the original type.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> No doubt in time
these imitations would become a mere convention. It should be
said in passing that the modern copies have a white porcelain
body, and to obtain the appearance of "brown mouth and iron
foot" the potters had recourse to the expedient of colouring the
parts concerned with brown ferruginous clay.</p>

<p>The <em>Cho kêng lu</em><a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> refers to three minor wares which were regarded
as inferior to Kuan ware, and later writers have assumed that they
belonged to the same category. These are the Hsü wares, Yü&ndash;hang
wares, and <em>wu&ndash;ni</em> wares. The first<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> is so little known that
its identity has been lost in variant readings, such as Hsün <img src="images/i_066a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in later
writers, which is very near in appearance to <em>tung</em> <img src="images/i_066b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, a common form
used for the Tung ware (see p. 82); and we can safely leave it until
some clearer information is forthcoming. The second, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to the <em>T´ao lu</em>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> was a Sung ware made at Yü&ndash;hang Hsien, in the
prefecture of Hang Chou. "Its colour was like Kuan porcelain
without its crackle, its lustre (<em>jung</em>), and its unctuous richness (<em>jun</em>)."
The <em>wu&ndash;ni</em> ware is dark&ndash;bodied earthenware, which is discussed
on p. 133.</p>

<h5><em>Ko yao</em> <img src="images/i_067a.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese characters" /></h5>

<p><em>Ko yao</em> (the elder brother's ware), or <em>Ko ko yao</em>, as it is sometimes
called with the first character repeated, is unanimously
ranked by Chinese writers with the Ju and Kuan wares. According
to the traditional accounts, it was first made by the elder of
the two brothers Chang <img src="images/i_067b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, who were potters of Lung&ndash;ch´üan
Hsien in the Ch´u&ndash;chou Fu, province of Chekiang, each having a
separate factory in the Liu&ndash;t´ien district. Most of the Chinese
authorities are content to give the date of these brothers as some
time in the Sung dynasty, but one account<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> narrows the period
down to the Southern Sung (1127&ndash;1279 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>). Professor Hirth
takes the rationalistic view that the story of the brothers is a myth
embodying the fact that there were two distinct types of ware
made in the Lung&ndash;ch´üan district. Be this as it may, the Ko
yao is of considerable interest to us as forming a link between
the obscure Ju and Kuan wares and the well&ndash;known Lung&ndash;ch´üan
celadon, approaching the latter in its grass green and sea green
varieties and the former in its most highly prized specimens
of bluish green or grey tones.</p>

<p>Of its close resemblance to the Kuan ware there can be no doubt,
for two highly reputable Chinese writers<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> describe the two wares
simultaneously and under one heading, enumerating their various
colours in order of merit as <em>fên ch´ing</em>, <em>tan pai</em>, and <em>hui sê</em> (see
p. 60), besides mentioning the several kinds of crackle which appeared
in the glaze. The only distinctions which the author of the <em>Ch´ing
pi ts´ang</em> draws between the two wares are that (1) the Kuan yao
crackle is of the "crab's claw"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> type, while that of the Ko is
like fish&ndash;roe,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and (2) the Ko glaze is somewhat less beautiful than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>the Kuan. With regard to the crackle, other writers assert that
short cracks are characteristic of the Ko yao, and one author uses
the picturesque phrase, "crackle of a hundred dangers."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Accidental splashes of contrasting colour, which sometimes
assumed fantastic forms, were common to the Ko and Kuan wares,
as mentioned on p. 65, and the author of the <em>Po wu yao lan</em> explains
these as "originating in the colour of the glaze and forming on
its outer surface," and as "due to the fire's magic transmutation."</p>

<p>Another account of the ware given in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> depicts
it as of deep or pale <em>ch´ing</em> colour, with brown mouth and iron foot,
and adds that when the colour was good it was classed with Tung<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
ware. The same passage further informs us that a great quantity
of the ware "recently made at the end of the Yüan dynasty"
was coarse and dry in body and inferior in colour, a statement to
which we shall return presently.</p>

<p>Other descriptive references to Ko yao include a verse on a
Ko ink palette belonging to Ku Liu,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> which was "green (<em>lü</em>) as the
waves in spring"; the eighteenth&ndash;century list of Imperial wares<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
which mention "Ko glazes on an iron body," of two kinds, viz.
millet&ndash;coloured and pale green<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> (or blue), both stated to have been
copied from ancient specimens sent down from the palace; and
a single specimen in Hsiang's Album, which is given as <em>fên ch´ing</em>.</p>

<p>In these various descriptions it is possible to recognise a celadon
green ware, green as the waves of spring, while the familiar stone
grey and buff crackled wares, which range from greyish white to
pale grey green and greenish yellow, seem to be indicated in the
expressions <em>mi sê</em>, <em>fên ch´ing</em>, <em>tan pai</em>, and <em>hui sê</em>. The modern
versions of the latter class, which are fairly common, are usually
known even to&ndash;day as <em>Ko yao</em>, the expression in potter's language
being practically synonymous with "crackled wares."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Other
ancient factories where similar wares were made are Hsiang&ndash;hu
and Chi Chou.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>As for the finer Ko wares, which appear to have been indistinguishable
from the Kuan, we may look for them in the group
described on p. 65, and in such beautiful pieces as that illustrated
on Plate 19, a vase of fine oval form with delicate grey glaze of
faint bluish tone boldly crackled. The solid quality of the glaze of
this last specimen and the texture of the surface, which is smooth
but lustrous, suggest some natural substance such as the shell of an
egg or a smooth polished stone rather than an artificial material.
The colour perhaps more truly answers the description "egg white"
(<em>luan pai</em>) than any other Sung glaze which I have seen. Plate 20
illustrates another choice example but with a yellower tone of glaze;
and a large square vase in the Freer Collection<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> with thick, misty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>grey glaze showing a faint tinge of red, which recall the <em>sê ch´ing
tai fên hung</em> of the Kuan ware, was shown in the New York exhibition
of 1914. All these three specimens have a dark reddish brown
body of fine close grain, and their glaze is very thick and unctuous
with a tendency to contract into thick wax&ndash;like drops under the
base.</p>

<p>From certain passages in the Chinese works it appears that a
revival of the Ko yao took place in the Yüan dynasty, if indeed
the manufacture had not been continuous. The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>,
for instance, under the heading of Ko yao, states that the "ware
recently made at the end of the Yüan dynasty was coarse and dry
in body and inferior in colour." In the <em>Po wu yao lan</em><a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> we read that
"certain Ko wares made in private factories took their clay from
the Phœnix Hill" (at Hang Chou, where the Kuan potteries were
located), and the <em>T´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> definitely states that clay was brought
from Hang Chou for this later Ko ware. Add to these the remark
in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> on the subject of Kuan ware<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>&mdash;"all the imitations
which are made at Lung&ndash;ch´üan are without crackle"&mdash;and
it is clear that the Lung&ndash;ch´üan potters in the fourteenth century
were busy copying both the Kuan and Ko wares, and that to obtain
a closer resemblance to the former they actually sent to Hang
Chou for the red clay which would produce the "brown mouth
and iron foot." The alleged absence of crackle would indicate
a departure from the original Ko methods, but we are at liberty
to doubt the universal application of such sweeping statements,
and I ventured to suggest<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> that a remarkable bowl in the British
Museum was a Yüan example of Ko ware, because, in spite of its
Ko crackle, it corresponds so closely to the other points in the
descriptions of this make. In any case, there is little doubt that
it belongs to an early period of manufacture.</p>

which would be still more interesting if we knew its date, serves
to illustrate some of the difficulties the Chinese collector had to face
in the past: "Ancient examples of Ko yao of the Sung period
have survived, though for a long time past genuine and counterfeit
have been confused together. Among men there are very
many who seek for the genuine Sung, but refined and beautiful
specimens are exceedingly few.... Ts´ao Chiung, a man of high
birth, secured an incense burner, in height about two inches and
in width proportionate. The cover was beautiful jade carved
with a pattern of sea waves of <em>Tung ch´ing</em><a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> colour, with a handle
in form of a crane, a genuine piece, and exceedingly beautiful.
It came to the ears of the eunuch Mai, governor of the district,
and he put Chiung in prison and subjected him to the inquisition.
His son had no choice but to offer the vessel as a gift. Later
the powerful hand of the superintendent of the Board of Rites
seized it. In the Chêng Tê period (1522&ndash;66) it was stolen, and,
coming to the district below Wu, it became the property of
Chang Hsin&ndash;fu of Tien&ndash;shan, Shanghai, who sold it for 200 ounces
of gold. After that it came again into the hands of a connoisseur,
and the Imperial authorities in the end did not succeed in recovering
it. This was a genuine antique Ko vessel."</p>

moved to Liu&ndash;t´ien while the younger brother remained at Lung&ndash;ch´üan
is, I believe, based on a misreading of a Chinese passage,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
the true meaning of which seems to be that while the elder brother
made new departures which earned for his ware the distinctive
name of Ko yao, the younger continued the Lung&ndash;ch´üan traditions,
and consequently his ware was known as Lung&ndash;ch´üan yao.
It appears that one vital difference between the two wares was
crackle, which was used by the elder and not by the younger
brother.</p>

<p>The productions of the Lung&ndash;ch´üan district are variously named
in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, "<em>Ch´u</em> ware" (from Ch´u&ndash;chou Fu, the
name of the prefecture), "<em>ch´ing</em> ware," and "old <em>ch´ing</em> ware,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and the various Chinese accounts agree in distinguishing two
broad classes, the one having a thin body of fine material, and
the other a thick body of coarser and heavier make.</p>

<p>The first of these two classes includes the Chang yao, or ware
of the younger Chang, of which the <em>Ch´ing pi ts´ang</em> gives the following
description: "There is one kind in the manufacture of which
white clay is used, and the surface of the ware is covered with
<em>ts´ui</em><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> glaze through which the white shows in faint patches. This
is what was made by the Chang family in the Sung dynasty, and
is called Chang yao. Compared with the Lung&ndash;ch´üan ware in
style and make, it gives the impression of greater delicacy and
refinement." Another writer<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> describes it as "single&ndash;coloured and
pure, like beautiful jade, and ranking with the Kuan yao; whereas
the Ko yao was pale in colour."</p>

<p>The eleven examples figured and described in Hsiang's Album
are all apparently of this class, and their colour is variously described
as "green, of jade&ndash;green tint (<em>ts´ui pi</em>), like a wet, mossy bank
or slender willow twigs," "green like the green of onion (sprouts)"
(<em>ts´ui jo ch´ing ts´ung</em>), "green like parrot's feathers," "green like
the dull green (<em>lü</em>) of a melon," and "soft jade&ndash;green like onion
sprouts in autumn." Hsiang's similes leave no doubt as to the
prevailing tint of the ware, which clearly aimed at rivalling the
tint of the prized green jade. As might be expected, few if any
of Chang's celadons are to be found in our collections. Relatively
few in numbers, assuming them to have been the work of one lifetime,
and slender in structure, it is improbable that many of them
can have survived the chances of eight or nine hundred years,
and even supposing that any of them have reached Europe, their
identity now could only be a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>The second class is best known to us in those thick, massive
porcelains with greyish white body and smooth grey green glaze
which have been named in Persian countries <em>martabani</em> and in
Europe <em>celadon</em>. The former name is no doubt derived from the
port of Martaban, on the coast of Pegu, a meeting place of Eastern
and Western traders, from which the Chinese goods were shipped
or transhipped for Europe and the nearer East. The latter name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
has a more capricious origin, deriving from the shepherd Céladon,
a stage personality whose familiar grey green clothing suggested
a name for the grey green porcelain. He appeared in one of the
plays founded on the early seventeenth&ndash;century romance, <em>L'Astrée</em>,
written by Honoré d'Urfé.</p>

<p>Large dishes and plates, bowls, vases, bulb bowls and jars of this
green ware have found their way to all parts of Europe in considerable
numbers, and they evidently formed a staple of far Eastern trade
in the Middle Ages. The subject of their distribution will be
treated presently. First, we must complete their description.</p>

<p>The ware, as a general rule, has a greyish white mass varying
from porcelain to stoneware, and with the peculiar quality of
assuming a reddish brown tint wherever the glaze is absent and
the "biscuit" was exposed to the fire of the kiln. It has, in fact,
the "iron foot" though not the "brown mouth," for the body
is of a whitish colour under the glaze, and consequently the mouth
of the vessel varies from green to greenish white, according to
the thickness of the glaze. The decoration is either carved, etched
with fine point, or raised in relief by pressing in an intaglio mould
or by the application of small ornaments separately formed in
moulds. All these processes are applied to the body before the
glaze is added, and the glaze, though covering them over, is transparent
enough to allow the details to appear fairly distinctly. In
the case of the applied reliefs, however, the glaze is often locally
omitted, and the ornaments stand out in biscuit, which has assumed
the usual reddish brown tint. This is well illustrated on Plate 21,
in which two brown fishes are represented swimming round a
sea green dish. A dish in the British Museum shows three fishes
swimming beneath the green surface of the glaze. This fish design
was frequent enough to have earned special notice in Chinese books,
which are excessively niggard in their enumeration of designs.
The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> for instance, says "there is one kind of dish
on the bottom of which is a pair of fishes, and on the outside are
copper rings attached to lift it."</p>

<p>Elaborate designs of flowers, flying phœnixes in peony scrolls,
dragons in clouds or waves, formed in relief by pressure in moulds,
were certainly used on Sung celadons just as they were in the
white Ting wares, but they seem to have been still more common
on the Ming wares. But the best and most characteristic Sung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
decoration was a beautiful freehand carving executed with admirable
spirit and taste, in those bold, half naturalistic, half idealised
sketches which distinguish the art of the time. Complex ornament,
such as landscape and figure subjects, is occasionally found on old
celadons; and there is one kind of bowl of rounded form with rather
high narrow foot which is decorated inside with groups of figures
carved or impressed in intaglio, the subjects being the eight Taoist
Immortals, or historical personages such as Confucius, the chess&ndash;playing
General, etc., usually labelled with their names in Chinese
characters. The glaze on these bowls varies widely in colour and
texture, being sometimes smooth celadon green, sometimes yellowish
or brownish green or again a pale apple green with crackled surface;
and it is possible that they come from some district other than
Lung&ndash;ch´üan.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The Lung&ndash;ch´üan celadon glaze is singularly beautiful with its soft,
smooth translucent texture and restful tints, which vary from olive
green through grass green and sea green to pale greenish grey,
occasionally showing a decidedly bluish tone. The ware has enjoyed
immense popularity in almost every part of the world for untold
years, and nowhere more than in Japan, where choice specimens have
always been highly valued, and it is not a little surprising to find that
in this country alone its merits are underestimated. The Chinese
themselves have been always loud in their praises of the finer
varieties, though they have not always spoken in complimentary
terms of the thick and massive types which were so suitable for
the export trade. Of these the <em>Ch´ing pi ts´ang</em> observes that they
readily withstand usage and handling, and do not easily break; but
the workmanship is somewhat clumsy, and the designs are lacking
in antique elegance. With the finer examples within reach, these
strictures were perhaps only natural; but there has never been any
doubt of the Chinese appreciation of the celadon glaze, for while
they have never ceased to reproduce it in other factories, it is always
the old Lung&ndash;ch´üan ware which serves as their standard and model.</p>

<p>The modern celadon glaze is made by mixing ferruginous clay
with the ordinary feldspathic glaze and adding a pinch of cobalt
(the mineral from which the blue colour is obtained) to give it
the requisite tone<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>; and it is certain that the colour of the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
celadons is due to the presence of oxide of iron, whether assisted
or not by oxide of cobalt. Possibly the earliest celadons were the
accidental result of the iron in a strongly ferruginous clay escaping
in the heat of the kiln and imparting a green tinge to an otherwise
colourless glaze. The conditions in the Lung&ndash;ch´üan district
would have specially favoured such an accident, for the local
clays were of the ferruginous kind, as is shown by their peculiarity,
which we have already noted, of turning red or reddish brown when
exposed without protection to the heat of the kiln. The presence
of iron in greater or less quantity is a common feature of potter's
clays all the world over, and it is usual in modern potteries to pass
the clay over strong magnets in order to remove this disturbing
element when a pure white ware is in view. This fact alone will
explain the prevalence of green tints of the celadon type among
the earlier Chinese wares, and observation of these results would
naturally lead to the discovery that a certain quantity of particular
clay mixed with the ordinary glaze would produce a beautiful
green colour, resembling jade. The reddish brown spots occasionally
observed in old celadon glazes are no doubt due to flaws
in the glaze&ndash;covering, which allowed a partial exposure of the body,
or to a local excess of iron oxide in the material. Like a great
many other accidental effects, these were turned to account by
the Chinese, and in some examples we find patches of brown which
evince a deliberate intention (Plate 21). These effects are highly
prized by the Japanese, who call the ware <em>Tobi seiji</em> or "spotted
celadon."</p>

<p>The manufacture of celadon must have been very extensive
in the Lung&ndash;ch´üan district. Besides the principal factories at
Liu&ndash;t´ien Shih, there were minor works at Chin&ndash;ts´un already mentioned,
and according to the <em>T´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> at Li&ndash;shui Hsien<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> in the Ch´u&ndash;chou
Fu, the latter already operative in the Sung dynasty. Its
wares were included in the comprehensive term <em>Ch´u yao</em>, and
"the material was coarse and thick, the colour similar to that
of Lung&ndash;ch´üan ware, both dark and light, but the workmanship was
coarser."</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Ming dynasty, we are told<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> that the
Lung&ndash;ch´üan factories were removed to Ch´u&ndash;chou, and that the
ware made on the new site was green (<em>ch´ing</em>), with a white body
which, like the older ware, assumed a red colour in the exposed
parts, but that the ware was not so good as the old. Local tradition
asserts that the celadon industry in the district came to an
end with the Ming dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Connoisseurs are much exercised over the differences between
Sung and Ming celadons. The <em>T´ao lu</em> tells us nothing beyond
the bare statement that the Ming ware was not so good, and the
two general rules which have been laid down<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> for our guidance&mdash;viz.
(1) that the colour of the Sung wares is deeper and more grass
green, that of the Ming more grey green, and (2) that the bottoms
of the Ming vessels are distinguished by an unglazed ring of reddish
brown colour&mdash;can only be accepted with reserve. Of the two
the colour test is probably the more reliable, but I have found
too many exceptions in which the grey green occurs on pieces of
obviously Sung origin to feel any great confidence in its guidance.
The ring test breaks down in practice, and is illogical in its conception,
implying, as it does, that the use of a circular support in
the kiln was limited to one particular place and period. On the
contrary, we know that this method of support was usual in the
Siamese factories at Sawankalok,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and apparently before the Ming
period, and as the Siamese potteries were started by Chinese,
probably sent from Western China, it is only fair to suppose that
this method of manufacture was in general use at an early date.
The safest criterion of Sung workmanship is the style of the ware,
and especially the boldness and freedom of the carved designs.
In the Ming period the Sung patterns already exhibit an inevitable
staleness and conventionality with a tendency to overcrowding
of detail. In some cases, too, the designs are of a later order,
and closely analogous to those of the blue and white Ming porcelains.</p>

<p>In addition to the Lung&ndash;ch´üan and Ch´u&ndash;chou celadons, which
are readily recognised by their peculiar glaze and their reddish
brown foot rims, there are many other kinds which are not easy
to classify. Some of these have a dry, buff stoneware body and
brownish green glaze, while others have a glaze of decided grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
or blue grey tone. In conjecturing the origin of these we must
take into consideration the private factories which existed under
the Northern Sung at Ch´ên&ndash;liu<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and other localities in the neighbourhood
of the eastern capital (<em>tung ching</em>), now named K´ai&ndash;fêng
Fu, in Honan. The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em><a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> describes the ware of
these parts under the heading <em>Tung yao</em><a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>: "It is pale green (<em>ch´ing</em>)
in colour, with fine crackle, and in many cases has a brown mouth
and iron foot. Compared with Kuan ware it lacks the red tinge,
and its material is coarse, wanting in fineness and lustre, and far
from equalling that of the Kuan ware. At the present day (i.e.
1887) it is rarely seen." Other writers repeat this passage with
little alteration, though the author of the <em>T´ao lu</em> adds that the
clay was of black colour and the glaze of varying depth. Hsiang's
Album includes one specimen of the <em>tung ch´ing tz´ŭ</em>, describing
the colour as <em>t´ieh ts´ui</em>, which probably means the blue green shade
of distant hills.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> <em>Tung ch´ing</em> glaze is included in the list of those
imitated in the Imperial factories about 1780, two kinds, pale and
deep, being specified; and the <em>T´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> informs us that the <em>Tung
ch´ing</em> was copied to a considerable extent at Ching&ndash;tê Chên in
the early nineteenth century, and that the modern glaze was
exactly like the old. That this modern glaze was only a variety
of celadon is shown by the recipe given in the same work,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> viz.
"to add to the ordinary glaze some of the mixture containing
ferruginous earth," which differs from that given for the modern
Lung&ndash;ch´üan glaze only in the absence of the pinch of cobalt (see
vol ii., p. 189).</p>

<p>A verse from a poem by Chang&ndash;lei (1046&ndash;1106) indicates the
green colour of the ware: "Green jade (<em>pi yü</em>) when carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
makes a vessel; know it to be the porcelain (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) of the Tung
kilns <img src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>In the classification of old celadons due account must be taken
of the imitations made from the earliest times at Ching&ndash;tê Chên.
Many of these would be distinguishable by their white porcelain
body, the ordinary porcelain clay of the district not having the
peculiar qualities of the Lung&ndash;ch´üan and Ch´u&ndash;chou Fu material.
In fact, we know that it has been a common practice in recent
times among the Ching&ndash;tê Chên potters to dress the exposed parts
of their ware with brown ferruginous earth when they wished to
reproduce the "brown mouth or iron foot" of the archaic wares.
Another method which was found effective by imitators of the
antique was to use a coarse yellowish clay for the body of the ware.
This, however, should be generally recognisable. But the skill of
the Chinese copyist is proverbial, and a good instance of his cunning
is given in the now celebrated letters of Père d'Entrecolles,
a Jesuit missionary stationed at Ching&ndash;tê Chên in the K´ang Hsi
period. The passage<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> is interesting enough to be quoted in full:</p>

<p>"The mandarin of <em>Kim tê Chim</em>, who honours me with his friendship,
makes for his patrons at the Court presents of old porcelain
which he has himself a genius for fabricating. I mean that he
has discovered the art of imitating antique porcelain, or at least
that of comparative antiquity; and he employs a number of workmen
for this purpose. The material of these false <em>Kou tom</em>, viz.
counterfeit antiques, is a yellowish clay, obtained in a place quite
near <em>Kim tê Chim</em>, called <em>Ma ngan chan</em>. They are constructed
very thick. The mandarin has given me a plate of this make, which
weighs as much as ten ordinary plates. There is nothing peculiar
in the manufacture of these kinds of porcelain beyond that they
are covered with a glaze made of yellow stone, mingled with the
ordinary glaze, the latter predominating in the mixture, which
gives the porcelain a sea green colour. When it is fired it is placed
in a very rich broth made of chicken and other meats; in this it
is baked a second time, and after that it is put in the foulest drain
that can be found and left for a month or more. On issuing from
this drain it passes for three or four hundred years old, or at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
rate for a representative of the preceding Ming dynasty, when
porcelain of this colour and thickness was appreciated at Court.
These counterfeit antiques resemble the genuine pieces also in their
want of timbre when struck, and if one holds them to the ear they
produce no reverberation."</p>

<p>The worthy father's acquaintance with the antiques was probably
limited, or he would not have instanced the last quality as
evidence of good imitation. On the contrary, the lack of timbre
would be regarded by Chinese connoisseurs as indication of a spurious
ware, the note of the old porcelains being one of the criteria
of their excellence. But the passage is otherwise most instructive.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, too, that at the time of which
d'Entrecolles speaks, an extensive use was being made at Ching&ndash;tê
Chên of a beautiful celadon glaze on a fine white porcelain body.
These celadons of the period will be discussed in their proper place,
as they make no pretence of antiquity and are easily distinguished
by their pure white body and pale soft green glaze. Indeed, they
often have the ordinary white glaze under the base and a period
mark in blue.</p>

<p>Another factory which made free use of the celadon glaze was
that of Yang Chiang, province of Kuangtung. As a rule, the
ware is recognisable by its reddish brown stoneware body, but
in cases where the biscuit is lighter in colour and more porcellanous
in texture, confusion may easily arise.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget the extensive manufacture of celadons
outside China itself. The Corean wares have already been mentioned.
As a rule, their soft velvety glaze is recognised by its
peculiar bluish grey tone, difficult to describe but easy to remember
when once seen. The colour, however, varies to distinctly greener
and browner shades, which are liable to be confused with Chinese
celadons of the Lung&ndash;ch´üan and northern types. Fortunately,
most, though not all, of the Corean decorations are very characteristic,
particularly the delicate inlaid designs<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> in white and black
clays; and the finish of the ware underneath is usually distinctive,
a very low foot rim, the base slightly convex, and the disfiguring
presence of the sand, which in three little piles supported the ware
in the kiln.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, however, quite a number of ambiguous celadons with
a brownish green glaze, usually bowls, of which some are decorated
inside with beautiful carved and moulded designs of bold foliage (Plate
18, Fig. 1) and even with the design of boys among flowering branches
and the slight combed patterns which are found on the Corean white
wares. Were it not for the apparently Chinese provenance of so
many of these bowls, and the absence of the Corean characteristics in
their bases, one would be tempted to class them as Corean on the
strength of their general appearance. Probably we have in this
group both the Chinese prototypes and the close imitations made by
the Corean potters who followed these models just as they followed
the white ware of Ting Chou. One of the combed bowls formerly
treasured as a tea bowl in Japan is now in the Kunstgewerbe
Museum, Berlin, but unfortunately the Japanese name <em>shuko&ndash;yaki</em>,
by which Dr. Kümmel informs me it was known in Japan, sheds
no light on the question of its origin.</p>

<p>The Sawankalok wares of Siam, too, have already had a passing
mention. These are easily distinguished by their coarse grey body,
reddish at the base, and thin, watery green glaze, very transparent
and showing a bluish efflorescence where it has run thick.
Once seen, they are hardly likely to be confused with any Chinese
celadon, except a few of the coarser Ming and later types, in
which the glaze happens to be very pale and thin. The Siamese
wares, moreover, usually have a small raw irregular ring under
the base, made by the end of a tubular kiln support, and differing
from the broad regular ring on the Lung&ndash;ch´üan dishes described
above.</p>

<p>But the most puzzling of the external celadons are those made
at various times and places in Japan. They are, as a rule, close
and careful copies of Chinese types, with which they are readily
confounded by persons not familiar with Japanese peculiarities.
In many cases, too, they will puzzle the most expert. It is well&ndash;nigh
impossible to put into words any distinctive criteria of these
wares. The biscuit is usually white and porcellanous, and though
it sometimes assumes a natural tinge of red at the base, the colour
is not so deep and decided as on the Lung&ndash;ch´üan wares. The
chief distinction is an inevitable Japanese flavour in the form and
decoration of the ware, but this, again, is an intangible feature which
can only be realised by the practised eye. Finally, it should be said
that remarkably close copies of the celadon green glaze (and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
typical ornament as well) were made in Egypt and Persia in the
late Middle Ages. At a short distance they might often be taken
for Chinese, but on inspection the body will be found to have that
soft, sandy texture which is an unmistakable characteristic of the
near&ndash;Eastern pottery.</p>

<p>It is impossible to leave the subject of celadon without a few
words on the distribution of the ware in the Middle Ages, though
I have no intention of embarking on the lengthy discussion which
the interesting nature of the subject invites, nor of reopening the
much&ndash;debated <em>Celadonfrage</em> which elicited many interesting contributions<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
from Professors Karabacek, A.B. Meyer, and Hirth,
and Dr. Bushell. Probably no single article of commerce can
tell so much of the mediæval trade between China and the West
as the old celadon porcelains whose fragments are constantly
unearthed on the sites of the old&ndash;world trading stations. The
caravan routes through Turkestan and the seaborne trade through
the Eastern Archipelago and the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf,
Red Sea, and east coast of Africa can be followed by porcelains
deposited at the various trading centres and ports of call. Much,
too, has been learnt from the writings of Chinese, Arab, and European
travellers and geographers. Professor Hirth, as early as
1888, worked out the principal routes of Chinese seaborne trade
from the "Records of Chinese Foreign Trade and Shipping,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
compiled by Chao Ju&ndash;kua about 1220 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, starting from the Tingui<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
of Marco Polo, which he identifies with Lung&ndash;ch´üan itself, and
finishing in Egypt and Zanzibar. The porcelain was carried by
land and river to the great port of Ch´üan&ndash;chou Fu, and thence
in junks to Bruni in Borneo, Cochin China, and Cambodia, Java,
Lambri, and Palembang, in Sumatra, where the traders of the
East and West met and exchanged goods. Thence the trade proceeded
to Quilom in Malabar, Guzerate, Cambray, and Malwa,
and as far as Zanzibar. Numerous other localities might be mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and much has been written<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> of the veneration in which
old Chinese wares have always been held in the Philippines and
Borneo, and of the magic powers attributed to the old dragon
jars by the natives of these countries.</p>

<p>The green celadon was highly valued in India and Persia, where
it was reputed to have the power of disclosing the presence of
poison. An early reference to the Chinese porcelain occurs in the
writings of the Persian geographer Yacut,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> who mentions "four
boxes full of Chinese porcelain and rock crystal" among the effects
of a native of Dour&ndash;er&ndash;Raçibi in Khouzistan, who died in 913 a.d.
The trade with Egypt is indicated in the much&ndash;quoted incident
of the gift of forty pieces of Chinese porcelain sent from Egypt
by Saladin to Nur&ndash;ed&ndash;din in Damascus in 1171, and by the later
gift of porcelain vases sent in 1487 by the Sultan of Egypt to Lorenzo
de' Medici. A large proportion of the celadons in our collections
has been brought and still comes from India, Persia, and Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
The Sultan's treasure at Constantinople<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> teems with celadons collected
in mediæval times. Fragments of celadon are unearthed on
almost every important mediæval site which is excavated in the
East. The British Museum has small collections of such fragments
from Bijapur in India, the island of Kais in the Persian Gulf,
Rhages in Persia, Ephesus, Rhodes, Cairo, and Mombasa, to mention
a few sites only. Fragments of celadon were found, in company
with Chinese coins ranging in date from 990&ndash;1111 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, by Sir John
Kirk and Lieut. C. Smith, near Kilwa in Zanzibar, and the former,
while British representative in Zanzibar, was able to form a considerable
collection of complete specimens which were treasured by
the natives with almost religious care. A story told by Sir John
Kirk illustrates the attitude of the native mind towards these
treasured wares. A celadon dish with particularly fine carving
was the subject of a family dispute, and to satisfy the rival claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a local Solomon decided that it should be divided between the
disputants. One large fragment of it is now in Sir John Kirk's
collection, which includes many interesting dishes, crackled and
plain, and ranging in colour from dark olive green to the pale watery
tint of the Sawankalok<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> wares. Other specimens of interest are
the large, wide&ndash;mouthed, bowl&ndash;shaped vases with sides deeply
ribbed or carved in high relief with bold floral designs. They have
the peculiar feature of being constructed at first without a bottom,
which was separately made in the form of a saucer and dropped
in, the glaze holding it firmly in position. Similar vases<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> have
been found in India and elsewhere. One of the first pieces of
celadon to arrive in this country was the celebrated Warham bowl,
which was bequeathed to New College, Oxford, in 1530 by Archbishop
Warham. It is of dull grey green celadon, the outside
faintly engraved with four lotus petals, each containing a trefoil, and
in the bottom inside is the character <em>ch´ing</em> <img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (pure) surrounded
by rays. It has a fine silver&ndash;gilt mount of English make.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> It
would be possible to multiply references to the traffic in celadon
wares which was carried on briskly between China and the West
in the Middle Ages, but enough has been said to give some idea
of the extent and nature of the trade, which was mainly in the
coarsest types of ware. Apart from the unlikelihood that very
fine or precious porcelains would be embarked on such long and
hazardous journeys, there was actually a law in force in China
as early as the eighth century<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> which forbade, under penalty of
imprisonment, the exportation of "precious and rare articles,"
anticipating by a thousand years the restrictive legislation of the
Italian Government.</p>

<p class="p6">TING YAO <img src="images/i_089.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese characters" /></p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>ING ware is by general consent ranked among the finer Sung
porcelains, and it is happily, like the Lung&ndash;ch´üan celadons,
fairly well known to Western collectors. Its name derives
from its place of origin, Ting Chou, the modern Chên&ndash;ting Fu, in the
province of Chihli, where the manufacture of a white ware, if not
actually a white porcelain, appears to have existed from remote times.
Indeed, the "white ware (<em>pai tz´ŭ</em>) of Ting Chou" is mentioned in
the middle of the seventh century,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> though nothing further is heard
of it until it came to enjoy the patronage of the Sung emperors.
As already hinted in connection with the Ju Chou porcelain, the
Ting ware suffered a temporary eclipse at Court owing to some
defects in the glaze; but it was not long in recovering its reputation,
for the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> states that it was at its best in the Chêng
Ho and Hsüan Ho periods, which extended from 1111 to 1125 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>,
and we learn that the Ting Chou potters accompanied the Court
in its flight across the Yangtse in 1127. The manufacture seems
to have been re&ndash;established after this event in the neighbourhood
of Ching&ndash;tê Chên, and the <em>nan ting</em> or Southern Ting ware is said
to have so closely resembled the original that to distinguish the
two in after years was regarded as a supreme test of connoisseurship.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Ting ware has a white body of fine grain and compact texture,
varying from a slightly translucent porcelain to opaque porcellanous
stoneware. Though not so completely vitrified as the more modern
porcelains, and lacking their flint&ndash;like fracture, it was nevertheless
capable of transmitting light in the thinner and finer specimens,
and consequently it can be regarded as one of the earliest Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>wares which fulfils the European definition of porcelain. The
glaze is of ivory tint, sometimes forming on the outsides of bowls
or dishes in brownish gummy tears, which were regarded by Chinese
collectors as a sign of genuineness.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The finer and whiter varieties
are known as <em>pai ting</em> (white Ting) and <em>fên ting</em> (flour Ting), as
distinct from the coarser kind, whose opaque, earthy body and
glaze of yellowish tone, usually crackled and stained, earned it the
name of <em>t'u ting</em> or earthen Ting.</p>

<p>In the best period the pure white undecorated Ting ware, with
rich unctuous glaze, compared to "congealed fat" or "mutton
fat," was most esteemed, though ornament was freely used, especially
on the Southern Ting. Designs carved in low relief or etched
with a point were considered best, the moulded and stamped ornament
being rightly regarded as inferior. There is a remarkable,
though sadly damaged, example of Northern Ting ware in the
British Museum. It was found in a Manchurian tomb of the twelfth
century, and bears out the current descriptions of the ware with
its fine white body, rich ivory glaze, and "tear drops" on the
reverse. The ornament, a lotus design in bold freehand carving,
displays all the freshness and power of Sung craftsmanship. This
dish has, moreover, a characteristic common to the Sung Ting
bowls and dishes, viz. the mouth rim is bare of glaze. Many of the
early wares were fired upside down, whence the bare mouth rim,
which was usually hidden by a metal band.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Favourite carved designs with the Ting potters seem to have
been the mu&ndash;tan peony, the lily, and flying phœnixes. They are, at
any rate, usually singled out for mention by Chinese writers.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Garlic
and rushes are also incidentally mentioned as motives, and a few
examples of a beautiful design of ducks on water are known in
Western collections. The moulded ornament is generally more
elaborate, dense peony scrolls with phœnixes flying through them,
radiating panels of flowers, dragons in clouds, fishes among water
plants and wave patterns, etc. To judge from Hsiang's Album,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>carved designs borrowed from ancient bronzes must have been
highly prized.</p>

<p>Of the three kinds of ornament usually associated by Chinese
writers with the Ting ware; the <em>hua hua</em> (carved decoration) and
the <em>yin hua</em> (stamped or moulded decoration) have already been
mentioned. The meaning of the third, <em>hsiu hua</em>,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> is not so clear,
as the phrase can bear two interpretations, viz. painted ornament
or embroidered ornament. In the latter sense it would suggest
a rich decoration like that of brocade without indicating the method
by which it was applied. But in the former it was the usual Chinese
expression for painted ornament, and it is difficult to imagine that
it was intended to indicate anything else in the present context.
On the other hand, no examples of painted Ting ware are known
to exist either in actual fact or in Chinese descriptions. This
anomaly, however, may perhaps be explained in one of two ways.
A creamy white ware of <em>t´u ting</em> type, boldly painted with brown
or black designs, is known to have been made at the not far distant
factories of Tz´ŭ Chou<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> in the Sung dynasty, and it is possible
that either the painted Ting ware has been grouped with the Tz´ŭ
Chou ware in modern collections, or that Chinese writers mistook
the Tz´ŭ Chou ware for painted Ting ware and added this third
category to the Ting wares by mistake. In any case they regarded
the painted ware as an inferior article.</p>

<p>The high estimation in which fine specimens of white Ting
ware have always been held by Chinese connoisseurs is well illustrated
by a passage in the <em>Yün shih chai pi t´an</em>.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> It tells how
Mr. Sun of the Wu&ndash;i river estate treasured in his mountain retreat
Ting yao incense&ndash;burners, and among them one exquisite specimen
of the Sung period. It was a round vessel with ear handles and
three feet, and the inscription <em>li hsi yai</em> (<img src="images/i_091a.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />) was engraved in
seal characters on the stand. During the Japanese raids in the Chia
Ching period this vessel passed into the hands of one Chin Shang&ndash;pao,
who sold it to T´ang, the President of Sacrifices (<em>t´ai ch´ang</em>),
of P´i&ndash;ling. T´ang, whose residence bore the romantic but chilly
name of Ning&ndash;an (Frozen Hut), is the celebrated collector mentioned
in connection with another Ting vessel on p. 95. "Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
T´ang had many wonderful porcelains," the story runs, "when
this vessel arrived, they all, without exception, made way for it.
And so throughout the land when men discuss porcelains, they
give the first place to T´ang's white incense vase. T´ang, they say,
did not readily allow it to be seen." And in this respect, if all
accounts are true, T´ang was not unlike a good many Chinese
collectors of the present day.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Ting ware was often marred by certain
blemishes which are not always easy to understand. The "awns"
(<em>mang</em>), for instance, which degraded it at Court in favour of the
Ju Chou ware in the early Sung period were probably flaws in
the glaze. The "bamboo thread brush marks" mentioned in the
<em>Liu ch´ing jih cha</em><a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> may perhaps be lines left in the glaze which
was applied by means of a bamboo brush. Three other defects
which rendered the ware comparatively worthless are named in
the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> viz. <em>mao</em> (thatch), <em>mieh</em> (bamboo splints),
and <em>ku ch´u</em> (bare bones). The author fortunately explains that
(1) to thatch (<em>mao</em>) means to cover over defects, (2) bamboo splints
(<em>mieh</em>) is used of lines and recalls the brush marks mentioned above,
and (3) bare bones (<em>ku ch´u</em>) are patches where the glaze is defective
and the body shows through. <em>Ku</em>, in the sense of "body or
biscuit," we are further informed, is a "curio&ndash;market expression."
Modern collectors will probably not be so fastidious as the Chinese
of the fourteenth century, and will welcome a Sung specimen of
Ting porcelain, even though it suffer from <em>mang</em> and <em>ku ch´u</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>pai ting</em> and the <em>t´u ting</em>, the fine and coarse white varieties,
alone have been identified in Western collections; but there are
coloured Ting porcelains which are known to us by literary references.
An apocryphal red Ting ware<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> (<em>hung ting</em>) is mentioned in
two passages of ambiguous meaning which need not necessarily
have implied a true red glaze. In any case it finds no place in
the older works, such as the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> and <em>Ch´ing p´i tsang</em>,
which only speak of purple or brown (<em>tzŭ</em>) Ting, and black Ting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>"There is purple<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Ting," says the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, "the colour of
which is purple; there is ink Ting, the colour of which is black,
like lacquer. The body in every case is white, and the value of
these is higher than that of white Ting."</p>

<p>Hsiang, who figured five specimens in his Album, compared
them to the colour of ripe grapes and the skin of the aubergine
fruit or brinjal, one specimen being <em>tzŭ ts´ui</em> (purple blue); and
he further states that out of a hundred and more specimens of
Ting ware he had only seen ten of purple and one of black colour.</p>

<p>The solitary specimen of black Ting, which appears in a very
unconvincing illustration in Hsiang's Album,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> is divided into
two zones, one black, the other white, and Hsiang regards it as
inestimably rare and precious. In this appreciation he follows the
<em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, but other writers, such as the author of the <em>Ch´ing
pi ts´ang</em>, take an entirely different view, holding neither the purple
nor the black Ting ware of much account. With us at present
the question is of academic interest only, as no examples of either
kind worthy of notice have been identified in Western collections.
The nearest approach to the description of the purple variety
which I have seen is a small box from a tomb in Shansi, made of
white porcellanous ware with a purplish black glaze on the cover.
It is, however, a crude object, and of no particular merit. As for
the black Ting, the nearest analogue to that which I can quote is
the vases with black or brown black glaze belonging to the Tz´ŭ
Chou class. Some of these (see Plate 30) have zones of black and
white recalling Hsiang's description. It is, perhaps, worth noting
in this connection that the black glaze on these wares was liable
to shade off into lustrous brown, indicating the presence of iron
oxide, and to resemble in this respect the so&ndash;called "hare's fur"
or "partridge" glazes of the celebrated Chien yao tea bowls.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
This fact may account for a passage in an early writer,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> who says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>"the ancients favoured as tea bowls Ting ware with hare's fur
marking, and these were used in the powdered&ndash;tea competitions,"
but the work deals with tea rather than ceramics, and it is probable
that a confusion had arisen in the author's mind between the Chien
yao tea bowls and Ting ware. On the other hand, it would appear
that bowls with glaze which has some analogies with the "hare's
fur" were made at an early date in Northern China. (See Fig. 1
of Plate 43 and p. 132.)</p>

<p>Though little is heard of the coloured Ting wares after the
Sung period,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> the manufacture of white Ting and the commoner
<em>t´u ting</em> continued at Ching&ndash;tê Chên and elsewhere. In fact, it
cannot be said to have suffered intermission up to the present
day. A few of these imitative wares of later date were of such
excellence as to merit historical notice. In the Yüan dynasty,
for instance, P´êng Chün&ndash;pao, a goldsmith of Ho Chou, in Shansi,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
was celebrated for his imitations of old Ting wares, and the <em>Ko
ku yao lun</em>, an almost contemporary work, describes his productions
as exactly like Ting ware when of fine body,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> but as being "short"
and "brittle," and consequently not really worth much. "But
dealers in curiosities give them the name of <em>hsin ting</em> or New Ting,
and amateurs collect it at great cost, which is most ridiculous."
Again, the <em>Po wu yao lan</em> describes another wonderful imitation
of Ting ware made in the sixteenth century<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> by Chou Tan&ndash;ch´üan,
a native of Wu&ndash;mên, who settled at Ching&ndash;tê Chên, and was reputed
the best potter of his time. Though, generally speaking, his
material was not as fine as the original, still his copies of <em>Wên wang</em>
censers<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and sacrificial vessels with "monster heads and halberd
ears" so closely resembled the originals that it was only necessary
to "rub away the kiln&ndash;gloss all over the surface" to make the
illusion complete. Among the literary references to pottery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>porcelain collected in books viii. and ix. of the <em>T´ao lu</em> is a story
narrated in the <em>Yün shih chai pi t´an</em>, illustrating the cleverness
of Chou Tan&ndash;ch´üan. Julien<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> has translated it as follows: "One
day he (Chou) embarked on a merchant boat from Kin&ndash;tchong
and landed on the right bank of the Kiang. Passing P´i&ndash;ling, he
called on T´ang, the President of the Sacrifices (<em>T´ai ch´ang</em>), and
asked permission to examine at leisure an ancient tripod of Ting
porcelain<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> which was one of the gems of his collection. With his
hand he took the exact measurements of the vessel; then he made
an impression of the patterns on the tripod with some paper which
he had hidden in his sleeve, and returned at once to Ching&ndash;tê Chên.
Six months after he returned and paid a second visit to Mr. T´ang.
Taking from his sleeve a tripod, he said to him, 'Your Excellency
owns a tripod censer of white Ting porcelain. Here is its fellow,
which belongs to me.' T´ang was astounded. He compared it
with the old tripod, which he kept most carefully preserved, and
could find no difference. He tried its feet against those of his
own vessel and exchanged the covers, and found that it matched
with perfect precision. T´ang thereupon asked whence came this
wonderful specimen. 'Some time ago,' answered Chou, 'I asked
your leave to examine your tripod at leisure. I then took all its
measurements with my hand. I assure you that this is a copy
of yours, and that I would not deceive you in the matter.' The
<em>T´ai ch´ang</em>, realising the truth of this statement, bought for forty
ounces of silver the tripod, which filled him with admiration, and
placed it in his collection beside the original as though it were its
double. In the Wan Li period (1573&ndash;1619), Tu&ndash;chiu, of Huai&ndash;an,
came to Fou&ndash;liang. Smitten with a deep longing for T´ang's old
censer, he could think of nothing else, and even saw it in his
dreams. One day he went with Kien&ndash;yu, the <em>T´ai ch´ang's</em> nephew,
and after much importunity he succeeded in getting from him for
a thousand ounces of silver the imitation made by Chou, and
returned home completely happy."</p>

<p>Other examples of Ting imitations in the late Ming period,
described in the <em>Po wu yao lan</em>, include "magnolia blossom cups;
covered censers and barrel&ndash;shaped censers with chain&ndash;armour pattern,
ball and gate embroidery and tortoise pattern mingled together
in an ornamental ground." But we gather that though these have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
been confounded with Chou's work they were inferior both in
material and workmanship to his early masterpieces.</p>

<p>At any rate, it is certain that besides these conspicuous craftsmen
whose names have become historical, there were many nameless
potters at Ching&ndash;tê Chên who devoted their skill to the imitation
of <em>pai ting</em> porcelain in the Ming and Ch´ing dynasties. Very
beautiful wares of this class are occasionally seen which have a
"slickness" of decoration and a mechanical refinement of finish
characteristic of an art which is already crystallised and has lost
its freshness and spontaneity. These are, no doubt, the work of
later copyists. Indeed, we are expressly told in the <em>T´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> that
at the end of the eighteenth century there were still potters at
Ching&ndash;tê Chên who made a specialty of <em>pai ting ch´i</em> or white Ting
wares. These, moreover, were makers of curiosities and ornamental
wares (<em>wan</em>), and they sometimes painted their wares with
underglaze blue.</p>

<p>Among the provincial wares of the Ting type the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>
mentions Hsiang yao, which "has crab's claw crackle. When
rich and lustrous it is highly esteemed, but when yellow and of
coarser material, it is of little merit or value." Another work<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
gives this ware a flattering mention in stating that the Ting ware
resembled Hsiang yao in colour. The locality of its manufacture
is left in doubt, but it was probably Hsiang&ndash;shan, in the Ning&ndash;po
prefecture of Chekiang. The <em>T´ao lu</em> names a good number of producers
of white ware, some definitely described as of Ting type,
among the lesser factories. Su Chou,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> for instance, in Anhui, in
the modern prefecture of Fêng&ndash;yang, had a pottery dating from the
Sung period. Its productions resembled Ting ware in colour, and
had a considerable reputation. In fact, when the Ting porcelain
became scarce the Su Chou ware was largely bought in Northern
China as a substitute, though in reality it was far from equal to
the genuine Ting.</p>

<p>Ssŭ Chou,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> too, another place in Anhui, had a pottery dating
from Sung times, which made wares of Ting type, and "persons
who liked a bargain often bought them in place of Ting porcelain."
In the same district, during the Yüan and Ming periods, a thin
white ware with "earthen" body was made at Hsüan Chou,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
which was evidently of <em>t´u ting</em> type. Brinkley<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> speaks of a
pottery of this kind which is greatly esteemed by the Japanese
under the name of Nyo&ndash;fu ware<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; and a little wine cup with a
slight engraved floral decoration in the British Museum is possibly
an example of this class. It has an earthy looking body,
and creamy white glaze, and is thin and very light to handle.

<p>In Kiangsu, the western portion of Kiang&ndash;nan, is the "white
earth village" Pai&ndash;t´u Chên,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> where potteries existed from Sung
times, making a ware of the local clay, very thin, white and lustrous,
beautiful in form and workmanship. Thirty kilns were
worked, chiefly by families of the name Tsou, under the direction
of a headman, the potters numbering several hundreds.</p>

<p>Under the heading of Hsi yao,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> the <em>T´ao shuo</em> alludes to four
factories in the province of Shansi, which are interesting to&ndash;day
in view of the various wares excavated in the railway cuttings
now under construction in that province. A fuller description of
these potteries is given in the <em>T´ao lu</em>, which mentions P´ing&ndash;yang
Fu in the southern half of Shansi as a pottery centre in the T´ang
and Sung dynasties, where the ware was white but disqualified
by a glaze lacking in purity. At Ho Chou, in the same district,
a superior ware was made as early as the T´ang dynasty, which
was even considered worthy of mention in the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, probably
because of the connection of P´êng Chün&ndash;pao (see p. 94)
with this place in the Yüan dynasty. The <em>T´ao lu</em> tells that the
Ho ware was made of fine rich material, the body unctuous and
thin, and the colour usually white, and that it was more beautiful
than P´ing&ndash;yang ware&mdash;a qualified compliment! A coarse pottery
made at Yu&ndash;tzü Hsien, in the T´ai&ndash;yüan prefecture in the north,
and at P´ing&ndash;ting Chou in the west, complete the quartet. The
former dated from T´ang times, and the latter, dating from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Sung, was made of a dark&ndash;coloured clay which gave a dusky tinge
to the white glaze. A small melon&ndash;shaped vase, reputed to have
come from a tomb in Shansi, is shown in Plate 11. It has a hard,
buff grey body, with a dressing of white slip and white glaze, the
effect of the combination being a pleasing surface of solid&ndash;looking
ivory white. A factory which made white wares in the neighbouring
province of Shansi is named in the twelfth century <em>Ch´ing
po tsa chih</em>.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> It was situated at Huang&ndash;p´u Chên, in Yao Chou,
where, as we are told in the <em>T´ao shuo</em>, they had at an early date
made flat&ndash;bottom bowls which were called "little seagulls." The
place is near Hsi&ndash;an Fu.</p>

<p>Wares of the <em>t´u ting</em>, the "earthy" Ting, type, with creamy
glaze, were made at Nan&ndash;fêng Hsien,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> in the province of Kiangsi,
during the Yüan dynasty; and at Chi Chou<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> in the same province
there were factories in the Sung dynasty which deserve some
attention. The latter were situated at Yung&ndash;ho Chên, in the Chi
Chou district, in the prefecture of Chia&ndash;an Fu, and one of the productions
appears to have resembled the purple (<em>tzŭ</em>) Ting ware,
though it was coarser and thicker, and of no great merit. The
<em>Ko ku yao lun</em><a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> speaks of five factories in this place producing
white and purple (<em>tzŭ</em>) wares, flower vases of large size and considerable
value, and small vases which were ornamented, and
crackled wares of great beauty. The best of these potteries belonged
to a man named Shu <img src="images/i_098a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />. We are further informed by the
<em>Chü chai tsa chi</em><a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> that Shu, the old man (<em>Shu wêng</em>), was skilled in
making ornamental objects, and that his daughter, <em>Shu chiao</em> (the
fair Shu), excelled him. Her incense burners and jars of various
kinds commanded a price almost equal to that of Ko yao. The
author proceeds to describe a dish and a bowl in his own collection
as of "grey ware with invisible blue<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> glaze, which was capable
of keeping water sweet for a month." It has been assumed
that the decoration of the "small vases" was painted,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> but
the expression in the text (<em>yu hua</em>)<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> gives no clue to the kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>of decoration, and we are left quite in the dark as to its real
nature.</p>

<p>The industry seems to have ended abruptly at the beginning
of the Yüan dynasty, the story being that when the Sung minister
Wên was passing by all the ware in the kilns turned to jade, and
the potters, fearing that the event might reach the Emperor's ears,
closed down the kilns and fled to Ching&ndash;tê Chên. The meaning
of this myth has never been satisfactorily explained, but it was
pointed out that a large number of Yung&ndash;ho names appear in the
early lists of Ching&ndash;tê Chên potters, and the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>
asserts that excavations on the site of the kilns were made in
the Yung Lo period (1403&ndash;1424), and that several kinds of jade
cups and bowls were found&mdash;cautiously adding, however, that
this might or might not have been the case. The ruins of the
Yung&ndash;ho potteries seem to have been still visible in the fifteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>From a passage in the <em>T´ao lu</em> we learn that crackle was a
speciality of some of the Yung&ndash;ho potters. Under the heading of
<em>Sui ch´i yao</em><a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> (crackle wares), we are told that "these are the wares
made in the Southern Sung period. Originally, they were a special
class of the ware made at Yung&ndash;ho Chên.... The clay was coarse
but strong, the body thick, the material heavy. Moreover, there
were 'millet coloured' (<em>mi sê</em>) and pale green (<em>fên ch´ing</em>) kinds.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
The potters used <em>hua shih</em> (steatite) in the glaze, and the crackle
was in running lines, like a broken thing. They smeared and
blackened the ware with coarse ink or ochreous earth; then they
finished it. Afterwards they rubbed it clean, and it was found
to have hidden lines and stains of red or black, like cracked ice,
beautiful to look at. There were besides pieces with plain crackled
ground, to which they added blue decoration." This appears to
be the first mention of painted blue decoration, and if it is true
that it was made in the Sung period, it carries this important
method back farther than has been usually supposed. Possibly
the ware was of the same type as the coarse crackled porcelain,
with roughly painted blue designs, found in Borneo and Malaysia,
where it is credited with great antiquity. There is a very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
specimen in the Kunstgewerbe Museum, Berlin, which bears
on this question. It came from Japan, where it had been treasured
as a Chinese tea bowl of the Sung period, and it has a brownish
green crackled glaze painted in dark blue with the characters
<em>O mi t´o fo</em> (Amitabha Buddha), which was sometimes written in
this way as a charm against evil.</p>

<p class="p6">TZ´Ŭ CHOU <img src="images/i_101.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese characters" /> WARE</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> LARGE and important class of wares, closely related to the
Ting group, was made at Tz´ŭ Chou, formerly in the Chang&ndash;tê
Fu in Honan, and now included in the Kuang&ndash;p´ing Fu in
Chihli. The name of the place, previously Fu&ndash;yang, was changed to
Tz´ŭ Chou in the Sui dynasty (589&ndash;617 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), and as it was derived,
as Chinese writers are careful to explain, from the <em>tz´ŭ</em> stone from
which the ware was made, we may infer that this material, and no
doubt the local potteries, assumed importance at this early date.
There were, in fact, a few fragments of pottery of the Tz´ŭ Chou type,
decorated with brown spots, among the Chinese wares found on the
ninth&ndash;century site of Samarra, in Persia, by Professor Sarre (see p.
148); and a finely painted fragment of a Tz´ŭ Chou vase in the Anthropological
Museum at Petrograd was brought from a site in
Turfan, which was in all probability as early as the tenth century.
Moreover, it is constantly asserted by traders in China that this
or that piece of painted Tz´ŭ Chou ware was found in a T´ang tomb,
and in many cases, such as that of the brown&ndash;painted vase with
lotus design mentioned on p. 33, the form of the specimen and
the style of the decoration are quite consistent with a T´ang attribution.
There is, however, no information on the subject earlier
than the Sung dynasty, when the Tz´ŭ Chou factories enjoyed a
high reputation.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> gives the following brief
notice of them under the heading "Old Tz´ŭ wares":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old Tz´ŭ wares (<em>tz´ŭ ch´i</em>) were made at Tz´ŭ Chou, in the
Chang&ndash;tê Fu in Honan. Good specimens closely resemble Ting
ware, but have not the tear&ndash;stains. There are, besides, specimens
with engraved and painted<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> ornament. The plain white pieces
command a higher price than Ting ware. The recent (i.e. late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>fourteenth century) productions of the factory are not worthy of
consideration."</p>

<p>If, as this account seems to imply, the Tz´ŭ Chou factories were
in low water at the end of the Yüan dynasty, like many other
potteries at this time, they managed to retrieve their fortunes,
for they still carry on an unbroken tradition to this day.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The
ware is in general use among the common folk of Peking and
Northern China,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and is still decorated (though coarsely) in the
antique style with free and sketchy painted designs in dark brown
and maroon slip, the body being greyish white, with creamy crackled
glaze. This is, of course, only one kind out of many, but the traditions
have been so closely preserved that from this type alone it
is easy to identify many Tz´ŭ Chou specimens among the early
wares which have lately come from excavations in China.</p>

<p>The quantity of pottery produced at Tz´ŭ Chou in the last nine
or ten hundred years must have been enormous, but as the post&ndash;Sung
wares do not seem to have appealed to Chinese connoisseurs,
little has been heard of it until recent times, and the stray specimens
which did find their way to Europe were either unclassified
or grouped with Corean specimens in deference to a mistaken
Japanese opinion.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Now, however, considerable interest has been
taken in the ware by Western collectors, and a plentiful supply
is forthcoming, so that it is possible to make a comparative study
of the different types, and to appreciate the varied and clever
decorative methods of the Tz´ŭ Chou potters. But the conservative
nature of the wares will always make it extremely difficult for
us to fix the exact period during the many centuries when any
individual piece was made, and the early dates assigned indiscriminately,
though perhaps excusable on account of the archaic character
of the painted decoration, should be accepted with caution.</p>

<p>The plain white Tz´ŭ Chou wares of the Sung period, which
favourably compared with the Ting porcelain, have been identified
in a few instances only by peculiarities of shape. Indeed, it is
unlikely that we shall have any other means of discriminating
them from the latter ware. But by far the largest group of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>the Tz´ŭ Chou family consists of the painted wares. Like the
rest of the Tz´ŭ Chou pottery which has so far been identified,
these have a greyish buff body of porcellanous stoneware usually
coated with a white clay slip and covered with a transparent
glaze almost colourless, but with a creamy tinge. On this
glaze, and sometimes under it, the painters executed rapid, bold,
and rather impressionist designs in shades of brown, varying
from black to a soft sepia colour. The earliest specimens seem
to have been of this kind, and it is certain that this method
of decoration was practised in the Sung period, if not earlier.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
In a few cases the glaze seems to have been omitted, the brown
painting appearing on a lustreless white slip; and where the
brown or black colour was laid on in broad washes, details were
often etched out with a pointed instrument. The black, moreover,
when in considerable areas, sometimes developed passages
of lustrous coffee brown<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> (due to the presence of iron), such as is
seen in the "partridge cups" of Chien yao. It is probable that
the Sung Tz´ŭ Chou ware, with its solid ivory white surface, often
crackled, and its sketchy floral designs, may have served as a model
to the Japanese for the Kenzan style of decoration and the ivory
white Satsuma faience.</p>

<p>Another style of ornament, which may date from Sung times,
and is certainly common on later wares, consists of a broad band
of floral scrolls, with large lily or aster flowers, enclosed by smaller
zones of floral pattern or formal designs. Next come the large
panels of figure subjects, usually of Taoist sages, or birds and animals
in foliage, enclosed by bands of formal ornament or floral scrolls.
In some cases a beautiful pale blue glaze of turquoise tint covers
this class of ornament (Plate 32, Fig. 1), strangely recalling
the Persian and Syrian pottery with still black paintings under a
turquoise glaze. Indeed, it was a common error a few years back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>to class the stray specimens of this type as Persian; but a comparison
with the brown&ndash;painted Tz´ŭ Chou specimens shows their
true origin, and the discovery of a small dish of this kind in a Sung
tomb<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> proves the antiquity of this method of decoration in China.</p>

<p>The brown and black was supplemented, in the Ming period
if not earlier, first by a maroon slip and later by iron red and
green enamel.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> A specimen with panelled decoration in these
colours was described by Brinkley<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> as having been preserved in
Japan since 1598, showing that this class of decoration was at
any rate contemporary with the "red and green family" of porcelain.
A specimen in the Benson Collection shows, further, that
aubergine and green were sometimes used in combination with
turquoise glaze, as in the Ming "three&ndash;colour porcelain." Under&ndash;glaze
blue is also found on Tz´ŭ Chou wares, but we have no clue
to the date when it was introduced.</p>

<p>The ordinary ware, made in quite modern times at Tz´ŭ Chou,
is illustrated by a small flask and a figure obtained by Dr. Bushell,
and now in the British Museum. Though decorated in the characteristic
style with slight sketchy design in brown and maroon,
they show a decided falling off when compared with the older
specimens. The body is a hard, greyish white stoneware; there
is no slip covering, and the glaze is yellowish, soft&ndash;looking, and
freely crackled, without the solid qualities of the older ivory glaze
on a white slip coating. I am inclined to think that this degenerate
type of ware dates back no farther than the nineteenth century,
and that the Tz´ŭ Chou pottery preserved its character up to and
perhaps throughout the eighteenth century. There are several
examples of pottery pillows, with body and glaze of good quality
and finely painted in black and brown, with panelled designs sometimes
containing floral motives, sometimes figure subjects. One
of these, exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1910,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> was
tentatively ascribed to the late Ming period. Since then the British
Museum has acquired another, and I have heard of two more in
private hands. The three last bear the mark of a potter named
Chang,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and on some of them we find additional inscriptions
containing the words <em>ku hsiang</em> (of old Hsiang) and <em>hsiang ti</em> (of the
region of Hsiang). Hsiang, I find, is the old name of Chang&ndash;tê
Fu, the prefecture in which Tz´ŭ Chou is situated, and this fact
definitely connects the ware with the factories under discussion.
At the same time the relatively large number of these pieces in our
collections and the style of Chang's mark seem to indicate that
they are of fairly recent date, probably not older than the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a greater age has been credited to these
pillows in the belief that they are "corpse pillows" recovered
from ancient tombs, a theory for which a quotation from a Ming
writer in the <em>T´ao shuo</em> is responsible.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> It is stated that "the pillows
of ancient porcelain that are two feet and a half long and six inches
broad may be used. Those only one foot long are known as 'corpse
pillows,' and are among the things found in ancient tombs; and
even when these are of white Ting Chou porcelain of the Sung
dynasty, they ought not to be used." Now the pillows made by
Chang and others are rarely more than a foot long, and according
to this passage should be regarded as corpse pillows. But I
cannot help thinking that either the measurements given are incorrect,
or that the figures are inaccurately quoted; for apart from
the difficulty of making porcelain pillows thirty inches long, such
a size would be wholly unnecessary, and is, in fact, more than
twice the length of the ordinary Chinese pillow, as we know from
existing examples in various materials. At the present day there
is no such distinction in size between the two sorts of pillow,
and de Groot<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> assures us that the head of the corpse is rested
on a small pillow "not differing from those in use among the
living."</p>

<p>From the same passage in the <em>T´ao shuo</em> we learn that a curious
belief existed in China that porcelain pillows were "efficacious in
keeping the eyes clear and preserving the sight, so that even in
old age fine writing can be read," and that this belief obtained
as early as the Sung dynasty, much use of such pillows having
been made in the court of Ning Tsung.</p>

<p>Among the many types of Tz´ŭ Chou ware, old and new, figures
and statuettes, usually of deities, played an important part. There
are examples of coarse modern figures in the British Museum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but there are others,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> strong and forcefully modelled, which rank
with the best ceramic statuary. These, no doubt, belong to
the older and better periods. A good example is shown in
Plate 32.</p>

<p>The other large group of Tz´ŭ Chou wares, that with engraved
designs (<em>hua, hua</em>), is perhaps the most interesting of the three.
One class, the white ware with carved ornament, if it existed, has
been merged, like the plain white, in the Ting wares. The vase
(Plate 33, Fig. 2) with brown glaze and panelled design exactly
corresponding to those of the typical painted wares, but engraved
with a pointed instrument through the brown glaze, forms a link
between the two main groups.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But the more characteristic Tz´ŭ
Chou engraved ornament is executed by what is usually known as
the <em>graffiato</em> process, the lines of the design being cut through a
layer of slip which contrasts in colour with the underlying
material. This is illustrated by those vases on which the ornament
is etched through a covering of white slip disclosing the
greyish body beneath, or, better still, by specimens like Plate 34,
Fig. 3, in which the ground of the pattern is freely cut away,
exposing considerable areas of the body.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The greyish body colour
combines with the transparent but creamy glaze to produce a
delicate mouse&ndash;coloured surface, from which the pattern stands
out in ivory white. In other cases a thick lustrous brown black
glaze has been boldly carved, leaving the design to contrast
with an unglazed grey biscuit (Plate 34, Fig. 3). By varying and
combining these different methods, and by changing and counter&ndash;changing
the slips, a great diversity of effects was readily obtained.
It has been frequently remarked that some of the engraved specimens
with bands of large foliage scrolls have an astonishing resemblance
to Italian <em>graffiato</em> ware of the sixteenth century; and this
resemblance is particularly striking when, as sometimes happens,
a green glaze is used instead of the ordinary creamy covering. No
doubt these carved wares, like their fellows with painted ornament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
were made for many centuries, but there is good reason to
think that they date back to early times, for fragments both of
the <em>graffiato</em> with white slip and mouse&ndash;coloured ground, and of
the dark brown glaze cut away, were found in Sir Aurel Stein's
excavations in Turfan on sites which can hardly have been open
after the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> An important example recently
acquired by the British Museum actually bears a Sung date. It
is a pillow with carved panels on the sides containing each a large
flower and formal foliage; and on the top is a panel with the
four characters <em>Chia kuo yung an</em> ("everlasting peace in the family
and state") etched in a ground powdered with small circles. This
panel is flanked by two incised inscriptions stating that the pillow
was made by the Chao family in the fourth year of Hsi Ning
(i.e. 1071 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>). I have seen one other dated specimen of <em>graffiato</em>
Tz´ŭ Chou ware with beautifully carved floral designs and an
inscription of the year 1063. Another Tz´ŭ Chou type is seen in
a pillow in the Eumorfopoulos Collection which has passages of
marbling in black and brown, and small black rosette ornaments
inlaid in Corean fashion. The variety of decorations used on
this group of wares seems to be inexhaustible.</p>

<p>It has already been hinted that other factories were at work
on the same lines as Tz´ŭ Chou, and as we have no means of identifying
their peculiarities, it would perhaps be safer to use some
such formula as "Tz´ŭ Chou type" in the ascription of doubtful
pieces. Po&ndash;Shan Hsien, in Shantung, was mentioned in a note
on p. 103, and the <em>T´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> gives a short account of another factory
at Hsü Chou,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> in Honan, where the <em>tz´ŭ</em> stone (see p. 101) was also
used in wares which were both plain white and decorated. This
factory was active in the Ming dynasty, and it is stated that its
wares were superior to the "recent productions"<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of Tz´ŭ Chou.</p>

<p>A reference to porcelain figures in Honan in the Sung dynasty
may be quoted in this connection. It occurs in the <em>Liang ch´i
man chih</em>, an early thirteenth&ndash;century work by Fei Kuan, and
runs as follows: "In Kung Hsien (in the Honan Fu) there are
porcelain (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) images called by the name of Lu Hung&ndash;chien. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
you buy ten tea vessels you can take one image. Hung&ndash;chien
was a trader who dealt in tea&mdash;unprofitably, for he could not refrain
from brewing his stock. Hung&ndash;chien formerly was very fond of
tea, and it brought him to ruin." Possibly the images of Hung&ndash;chien,
which were given away with ten tea vessels, were made at
Tz´ŭ Chou or Hsü Chou. Figures are still part of the stock&ndash;in&ndash;trade
of the former factory.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE Chün ware is said to have been first made in the early
part of the Sung dynasty at Chün Chou or Chün&ndash;t´ai, the
modern Yü Chou in the K´ai&ndash;fêng Fu in Honan. Like the
Lung&ndash;ch´üan celadon, thanks to its strength and solidity, it has survived
in sufficient numbers to give us some idea of the qualities which
Chinese writers have described in picturesque terms. That it finds no
mention in the <em>Cho kêng lu</em> and the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> seems to imply
that it was not appreciated by the virtuosi of the fourteenth
century, owing, no doubt, to the fact that, as hinted in later works,
it was chiefly destined for everyday uses and aimed at serviceable
qualities rather than "antique elegance." By the end of the Ming
dynasty, however, its beautiful glazes had won it a place among the
celebrated Sung wares, although even at this time certain varieties
only were considered estimable. The <em>Ch´ing pi ts´ang</em>, for instance,
which appears to rank the Chün ware above that of Lung&ndash;ch´üan,
gives the following criticism: "The Chün Chou ware, which is
red like rouge, is highly prized; that which is <em>ch´ing</em> like onion
blue (<em>ts´ung ts´ui</em>), and that which is purplish brown (<em>tzŭ</em>) like ink,
are esteemed second; single&ndash;coloured pieces, which have the
numerals one, two, etc., as marks on the bottom, are choice; the
specimens of this ware with mixed colours (<em>tsa sê</em>) are not worth
collecting." It was not long, however, before even the despised
"mixed colours" were not only appreciated by collectors, but
studiously imitated by the Ching&ndash;tê Chên potters.</p>

<p>The body of the wares, which are now classed as "Chün type,"
varies considerably in quality and texture. The choicest examples
in Western collections, usually deep flower pots or shallow bulb
bowls with lovely glazes of dove grey, lavender, crushed strawberry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
dappled purple and crimson, and other tints, are made of
a clay which, though dark&ndash;coloured on the exterior, shows considerable
refinement and closeness of texture within. It is, in
fact, a porcellanous ware of whitish grey tone. It is noticed that
these pieces are almost always marked with incised Chinese numerals,
and there are critics who would confine the Chün wares to this
group alone. But it is clear from a passage in the <em>Po wu yao lan</em><a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
that there were other types in which the body was of "yellow
sandy earthenware," coarse and thick, and without refinement,
with all the characteristics, in fact, of the ware which these same
critics habitually relegate to the category of <em>Yüan tz´ŭ</em>, or ware
of the Yüan dynasty. But we shall return to this question later.
Modern Chinese collectors, we are told,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> in recognition of these
distinctions, classify Chün wares in two groups, <em>tz´ŭ t´ai</em> (porcelain
body) and <em>sha t´ai</em> (sandy, or coarse&ndash;grained, body).</p>

<p>The Chün glazes are of the thick, opalescent kind which flows
sluggishly and often stops short of the base in a thick, wavy roll
or in large drops. On the upper edges of the ware they are thin
and more or less transparent and colourless, but in the lower parts
and the hollows in which the glaze collects in thick masses the
depth and play of the colour are wonderful. These irregularities
are specially noticeable on the coarse bodies, but even on the more
refined specimens where the glaze has a smoother flow and more
even distribution, the colour is never quite continuous or unbroken.
In the opalescent depths of the glaze, bubbles, streaks, hair&ndash;lines,
and often decided dappling are observed, and a scarcely perceptible
crackle is usually present.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Some of these markings which variegate
the surface of the Chün wares have been noticed by Chinese
writers as "hare's fur marking" and "flames of blue."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Others,
which appear to be irregular partings in the colour of the glaze,
have been named <em>ch´iu ying wên</em> or "earthworm marks." These
last rarely appear except on the finer type of Chün wares, and,
like the "tear stains" on the Ting porcelains, they are regarded
as signs of authenticity.</p>

<p>Though the beautiful Chün wares of the <em>tz´ŭ t´ai</em> group will always
be rare and costly, Western collectors have been fortunate in securing
a fair number of specimens, and a wonderful series of them
was brought together in March, 1914, in the exhibition held by the
Japan Society of New York. The forms of the flower pots vary
considerably. Some have globular body with high spreading neck
and wide mouth; others are bell&ndash;shaped like a deep cup; others
are deep bowls with sides shaped in six or eight lobes like the petals
of a flower; others are of quatrefoil form; and others of oblong
rectangular shape with straight sides expanding towards the mouth.
The saucers in which they stood are shallow bowls corresponding
in form to the pots, but supported by three or four feet which are
usually shaped like the conventional cloud scroll or <em>ju&ndash;i</em> head. They
are otherwise without ornament, except in the case of the plain
rounded saucers, which have two bands of raised studs or bosses,
borrowed, no doubt, from a bronze vessel. These flower pots and
saucers are almost invariably incised with a numeral under the
base, and the fact that when the pots and saucers fit properly the
numerals on each are found to tally seems to indicate they are,
as suggested below, size numbers. But there is no doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the saucers or stands were often used separately as bulb bowls,
like the vessels of similar shape which are found in celadon and
other wares. Vases of the fine Chün ware are occasionally seen.
There is a choice example in the Pierpont Morgan Collection, a
small ovoid vase with flat base; and in the same collection is a
low beaker&ndash;shaped vase with flaring neck and globular body strengthened
with four square ribs in imitation of a bronze.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> No numbers
have appeared so far on any of these vases, nor, as far as I am
aware, on any Sung Chün wares except the flower pots and saucers.
I have, however, seen dishes on which a number has been subsequently
cut, and numbers occur on later copies of the Chün types
described below.</p>

<p>The numerals engraved under the base of the flower pots,
saucers, and bulb bowls in the finer Chün wares range from
1&ndash;10. Their significance has given rise to some debate, but the
most reasonable theory seems to be that they indicate the sizes
of the different forms, No. 1 being the largest, though an extra
large bulb bowl<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> in the Eumorfopoulos Collection has the additional
mark <img src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>ta</em> (great). This is the view which, I believe, is usually
accepted in China, and Mr. Eumorfopoulos, who has an exceptional
series of these wares, has applied the test to all he has seen, and
has found the size theory to hold good in all but a few cases, for
which an explanation may yet be found.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Another suggestion,
supported by some American collectors of note, such as Mr. Freer
and Mr. Peters, is that the numbers refer to the Imperial kilns,
and that the pieces so marked are Imperial wares. Whether the
former theory will continue to stand the test of application to
every fresh specimen remains to be seen. With regard to the
latter, I shall give reasons presently for doubting that any special
Imperial patronage was extended to this kind of ware; and whatever
truth there may be in this explanation of the numbers, it is
highly improbable that any serious evidence can ever be produced
to sustain it.</p>

<p>It would be possible to construct a formidable list of the
colours which appear in the Chün glazes, though many of the
accidental effects would be very difficult to describe. On the edge
and salient parts where the glaze is thin the colour is usually a transparent
olive green which passes with the thickening of the glaze into
a frothy grey shot with fine purple streaks. The grey sometimes
remains thick and opaque, covering large areas, and it is liable to
become frosted over with a dull film of crab&ndash;shell green. It is in
this frosting and in the opaque curded grey that the <b>V</b>&ndash;shaped and
serpentine partings known as "earthworm marks" most frequently
occur; and sometimes a steel blue colour emerges in these partings
and in small spots in the grey. For under the grey there seems
to be always blue and red struggling upwards towards the surface.
Hence the blue and lavender tinge which is so constant, the
<em>t´ien lan</em> of the Chinese. But it is the red which almost always
triumphs, emerging in fine streaks of purple, crimson or coral, like
the colour lines in shot silk, or in strong flecks and dappling, completely
overpowering the grey, which only remains on sufferance in
a few fleecy clouds. The fine lines of colour are usually associated
with a smooth silken surface to which a faint iridescence gives
additional lustre; whereas the strongly dappled and mottled glaze
is full of bubbles and pinholes (sometimes called "ant tracks"
by the Chinese) which give the surface the seeded appearance of
a strawberry. The red dappling is usually opaque and tending
towards crimson or rouge red. It will be seen that the red varies
in quantity from a mere tinge or flush to the intensity almost of
a monochrome, and in tone from a pale or deep lavender to aubergine,
plum purple, rose crimson, and rouge red. Making allowance
for the capricious nature of Chinese colour words, these tints
will be found to correspond with several of those indicated in the
Yung Chêng list quoted on p. 119. On rare examples the grey and
red colours are in abeyance, and the dominant tint is the transparent
olive green, which is usually confined to the edges. This
and the crab&ndash;shell green mentioned above supply the green shades
which the Chinese writers include among the Chün colours.</p>

<p>But none of these glazes can with strict accuracy be described
as monochromes "of uniformly pure colour" which the <em>Po wu
yao lan</em> seems to have regarded as indispensable in the first&ndash;class
Chün ware. In fact, it is difficult to conceive the possibility of
a Chün glaze of perfectly uniform tint, without any trace of the
perpetual war waged in the kiln between the red, grey, and blue
elements. The nearest approach to a single colour is seen in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of the grey glazes, but here, too, the colour is only relatively pure;
and I am convinced that the expression used by the <em>Po wu yao
lan</em> is exaggerated, and the meaning is that the nearer the Chün
colours approach to uniformity the more they were prized. It is
true that several examples depicted in Hsiang's Album are monochrome
purple, but I have no more confidence in the colouring
of these illustrations than in the carved decoration which is indicated
under their glaze, a phenomenon unrecorded in any other
Chinese work, unexampled in any known specimen of the ware,
and unlikely in view of the nature and the thickness of the Chün
glaze itself.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that an exaggerated mottling of the glaze
and a confusion of many colours was viewed with disfavour by the
old Chinese connoisseurs. These effects were explained in the <em>Po
wu yao lan</em> as due to insufficient firing. Regarded in this light they
were viewed with contempt by the earlier Chinese writers and
labelled with mocking names, such as <em>lo kan ma fei</em> (mule's liver
and horse's lung), pig's liver, and the like. In reality, they were
the forerunners of the many delightful <em>flambé</em> glazes which the
eighteenth&ndash;century potters were able to produce at will when they
had learnt that, like all the Chün colours except the brown glaze
on the base, they could be obtained from oxide of copper under
definite firing conditions. How far the old Chün effects were due
to opalescence<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> it is impossible to say, but we know that all of
them can be obtained, whether turquoise, green, crimson, or lavender
grey, by that "Protean medium," oxide of copper, according as
it is exposed in the firing to an oxidising or reducing atmosphere,
conditions which could be regulated by the introduction of air on
the one hand, or wood smoke on the other, at the right moment
into the kiln.</p>

<p>It should be added that the finer Chün wares as seen in the
flower pots and stands have an olive or yellowish brown glaze over
the base, which in rare instances is overrun by frothy grey or
lavender. Another constant feature of these pieces is a ring of
small scars or "spur marks" on the base.</p>

with the addition of four kinds obtained from other sources.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The potters of the Yung Chêng period (1723&ndash;35) succeeded
wonderfully in their work of imitation, and existing examples bear
witness to the beautiful colour effects which they obtained. The
body of the ware, however, was, as a rule, a fine white porcelain,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
which had to be carefully concealed by the brown glaze on the
base. Many of the Yung Chêng specimens are marked with the
seal mark of the period, and occasional instances occur in which
this mark has been ground off in order to pass the piece as old. I
have such a specimen, which was actually bought in the trade for
Sung. It is a small dish, with beautiful turquoise green glaze in
the centre and a <em>flambé</em> red on the sides. The place where the
mark has been ground away when washed clean showed a fine
white porcelain body. It is stated in the <em>T´ao lu</em> that the potters
at Ching&ndash;tê Chên began to imitate the Chün wares towards the
end of the Sung dynasty. No evidence is given to support the
assertion, which may be merely a local tradition; but one certainly
sees occasional specimens with a porcelain body masked
by a dark brown clay dressing under the base, the glazes of which
obviously imitate the Chün. There are, for instance, saucers and
bowls of this kind with purple glaze finely shot with grey on the
exterior and a lavender grey inside which appear to be older than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the Yung Chêng period, though their shape precludes a greater age
than the Ming dynasty.</p>

<p>There are, however, many other imitations of Chün ware in
which the body is not of tell&ndash;tale white porcelain. The <em>Po wu
yao lan</em>, for instance, written at the end of the Ming dynasty, states
that "in the present day among the recent wares all this type of
ware (viz. the Chün type) has the sandy clay of Yi&ndash;hsing<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> for its
body; the glaze is very similar to the old, and there are beautiful
specimens, but they do not wear well." Yi&ndash;hsing is the place where
the red stoneware tea pots, often called Chinese "buccaro," were
made, and we know that a Yi&ndash;hsing potter, named Ou, was famous
at the end of the Ming dynasty for his imitations of Ko, Kuan,
and Chün glazes.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> A bowl in the British Museum seems to answer
the description of Ou's ware. It has a hard red stoneware body,
and a thick undulating glaze of pale lavender blue colour, the comparative
softness of which is attested by the well&ndash;worn surface of
the interior.</p>

<p>The "Yung Chêng list" includes yet another type based upon
Chün ware. It is called "Chün glaze of the muffle kiln," clearly
a low&ndash;fired enamel rather than a glaze, whose colour is between
the Kuangtung ware and the added<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> glaze of Yi&ndash;hsing, though
in surface&ndash;markings, undulations and transmutation tints it surpasses
them. This appears to be the "robin's egg" type of
glaze,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> to use the American collector's phrase, a thick, opaque
enamel of pale greenish blue tint flecked with ruby red (see
Plate 128).</p>

<p>The manufacture of glazes of the Chün type has continued at
Yi&ndash;hsing since the days of Ou, and what is called Yi&ndash;hsing Chün
is still manufactured in considerable quantity, the streaky lavender
glazes being of no little merit. When applied to incense burners
and vessels of archaic form, they are capable of being passed off
as old, though the initiated will recognise them by their want of
depth and transparency and by the peculiar satiny lustre of their
surface.</p>

<p>Another ware which has a superficial resemblance to Chün yao
has been made for a long period at the Kuangtung factories,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> if
it does not actually go back to Sung times. A typical specimen,
shown in Plate 51, is a vase of baluster form with wide shoulders
strengthened by a collar with foliate edge, and small neck and
mouth, ornamented with a handsome lotus scroll in relief. The
body is a buff stoneware, and the glaze is thick, opaque, and closely
crackled, and of pale lavender grey warming into purple.</p>

<p>Glazes of this kind have been made at several potteries in Japan
e.g. Hagi, Akahada, and Seto.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Besides such specimens as this,
there are many of the streaky, mottled Canton stonewares which
are remotely analogous to the variegated Chün wares. The glazes
of this type are more fluescent than those described in the preceding
paragraph and have greater transparency, and the intention
of their makers to imitate Chün types is shown by incised
numerals which are occasionally added under the base. They are
known in China as Fat&ndash;shan Chün, from the locality in which they
are made, and though some examples may go back to Ming times,
the best may, as a rule, be ascribed to the eighteenth century and
the indifferent specimens to the present day.</p>

<p>From this digression on Chün imitations to which the mention
of Yi&ndash;hsing led us, we must return to the original wares. It has
been said that Chinese connoisseurs recognise two groups of Chün
ware, the <em>tz´ŭ t´ai</em> and the <em>sha t´ai</em>, and there is no doubt that the
contrast between the body material of the two is very marked.
In explanation of this the Chinese to&ndash;day allege<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> that the flower
pots and stands were made of a tribute clay sent annually from
the Ching&ndash;tê Chên district to the "Imperial kilns" at Chün Chou,
and that the coarser articles were made of native clays. The story
has the air of an <em>ex post facto</em> explanation, and it is open to many
grave objections. In the first place it is nowhere mentioned in
Chinese literature, and in the second place the Chün Chou kilns,
so far from having been described as "Imperial" in the Sung
dynasty, are entirely ignored by the earlier writers, and even in
the late Ming works, where they are first mentioned, the Chün wares
are reckoned as of secondary importance. Thirdly, there does not
seem to have been any need to import kaolin, for Chün Chou was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
one of the kaolin producing districts of China.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> There are, moreover,
many specimens of the Chün type which hold an intermediate
position between the finer flower pots and the coarse "Yüan tz´ŭ"
wares, and these have a decidedly porcellanous body, though inclined
to be yellowish at the base rim. Some of these have glazes
almost as smooth and even as the flower pots, and of a beautiful
lavender grey colour with patches or large areas of aubergine or
amethystine purple, which in rare cases covers the entire exterior
of a bowl. In their finer types they are scarcely distinguishable
from the specimens which we have tentatively classed as Kuan on
p. 65, and in their coarser kinds they seem to belong to the so&ndash;called
"Yüan tz´ŭ" which are discussed at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we must consider a very distinctive group to which
the term <em>sha t´ai</em>, in its sense of "sandy body," applies with particular
exactitude. In the catalogue of the New York exhibition
of March, 1914, I ventured to differentiate this type by the name
of "soft Chün," which its general appearance seems to justify.
It is well illustrated in Plates 38 and 39. The body is buff and
varies in texture from stoneware to a comparatively soft earthenware
not far removed in colour from that of delft or maiolica,
though, like so many Chinese bodies, it has a tendency to assume
a darker red brown tint where exposed at the foot rim. The glaze
is unctuous and thick, but not opaque, often, indeed, showing considerable
flow and transparency: it is opalescent, and at times
almost crystalline, and endued with much play of colour. It varies
from a light turquoise blue of great beauty to lavender and occasionally
to a strong blue tint, and, as a rule, it is broken by one
or more passages of crimson red or dull aubergine purple, sometimes
in a single well&ndash;defined patch, sometimes in a few flecks or
streaks, and sometimes in large irregular areas. This glaze usually
covers the entire exterior and appears again under the base, leaving
practically no body exposed except at the actual foot rim. It has
been attributed to various factories. The pure turquoise specimens
have even been called Ch´ai, and a little piece of this kind was
figured by Cosmo Monkhouse<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> as Kuan ware. On the other hand,
I am told<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> that it is widely known in China as <em>Ma chün</em>,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and is
usually thought to be of the Ming dynasty, but no reason is assigned
for either the name or the date, and both seem to be based on
traders' gossip to which no special importance need be attached.
A fine vase of this kind in the British Museum has been much admired
by Chinese connoisseurs, and they have, as a rule, pronounced it to
be Sung. The important specimen (Plate 39) in the FitzWilliam
Museum, Cambridge, was obtained from a tomb near Nanking,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> a
circumstance which is in favour of an early origin. In other respects
this class of ware seems to answer to the aubergine and "sky
blue" Chün types described by Chinese writers, and I regard it as
one of the Sung varieties of Chün Chou ware, with "yellow, sandy
earthenware" body of which the <em>Po wu yao lan</em> makes mention.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>That it continued to be made after the Sung period is practically
certain, and there are specimens which one would unhesitatingly
regard as Ming or Yüan from their form. But, on the other hand,
the prevailing shapes are of the Sung kind, and we have very little
to guide us in dealing with the various Chün types except the form
and the quality of the ware. The "soft Chün" was very closely
imitated at Yi&ndash;hsing on a yellowish body which resembles the
original in colour, but is generally harder, with a thick unctuous
glaze of somewhat crystalline texture and a turquoise lavender
colour, with rather thin and feeble patches of dull crimson, which
lack the spontaneous appearance of the originals. These Yi&ndash;hsing
copies are often marked with an incised numeral like the Canton
Chün.</p>

<p>With regard to the duration of the Chün Chou factories, the
standard Chinese works on ceramics are curiously silent. They
take no account of the ware after the Sung period, and leave us
to infer that it either ceased to be made or ceased to be worthy
of mention after that time. In two places only have I found any
hint of its survival in later times. One is an incidental mention
of Sung, Yuan, and Ming Chün wares in a modern work,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and the
other is in the pottery (not the porcelain) section in the great K´ang
Hsi Encyclopædia.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The latter passage is taken from the administrative
records of the Ming dynasty, and contains two references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to large supplies of vases (<em>p´ing</em> and <em>t´an</em>) and wine jars obtained
from Chün Chou and Tz´ŭ Chou in the Hsüan Tê period (1426&ndash;1436)
and in the year 1553 of the Chia Ching period. We further learn
that in 1563 an Imperial edict abolished both the tax which had
previously been levied on the Chün Chou wares and the subsidy
which had to a great extent counterbalanced the tax. These documents
prove beyond doubt that potteries of considerable size existed
at Chün Chou in the Ming dynasty, though their mention in this
particular context seems to imply that the ware was no longer
ranked among the porcelains, and had apparently ceased to be
regarded as an artistic production.</p>

<p>From this time onwards to the present day the ceramic history
of this district is a blank, and we are unable to say whether the
modern Yü Chou pottery is a continuation or only a revival of
the ancient art of the place. A specimen of this modern ware in
the Field Museum, Chicago, has close affinities with the "soft
Chün." Its base shows a buff stoneware body washed over with
dark brown clay, and the glaze is somewhat opalescent though
thinner than the old glaze, and its colour is a light blue of a tint
more grey than turquoise. Quantities of this modern Yü Chou
ware are to be found in Peking, and occasionally it is passed off
as old Chün, but no one with experience of the originals would
be deceived by it.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the important group of wares obviously belonging
to the Chün family but commonly described as Yüan tz´ŭ or
ware of the Yüan dynasty (1280&ndash;1367), although no sanction for
this name is found in the older Chinese books. The ware, however,
is fairly common in the form of bowls, shallow dishes, and, more
rarely, vases and incense burners. The bowls which are the most
familiar examples are usually of conical form, with slightly contracted
mouth and small foot, coated with thick fluescent glazes,
which form in deep pools at the bottom within, and end outside in
thick drops or a billowy line some distance above the base, leaving
a liberal amount of the body material exposed to view. The body
is of the <em>sha t´ai</em> class and usually of coarse grain, varying from
a dark iron grey to buff stoneware and soft brick red earthenware,
though, as already noted, there are finer specimens which link it
with the <em>tz´ŭ t´ai</em> group. It is this roughness of substance which
has caused the ware to be relatively little esteemed in China, for
the glaze is often of singular beauty. The varieties in colour are
innumerable and clearly due to the opalescence of the thick, bubbly
glaze, combined with the ever&ndash;changing effects of copper oxide on
a highly fired ware. Lavender grey, dove grey, brown, and grey
green are conspicuous, but as the thickness of the glaze varies
with its downward flow, so the colour changes in tone and intensity
from a thin, almost colourless skin on the upper edges to deep
pools of mingled tints where the glaze has collected in thick masses.
It is usually streaky and shot with fine lines of colour, but sometimes
there are large areas of misty grey or greenish brown tones
too subtle for description. A section of these glazes will generally
disclose the presence of red, and this red often bursts out on the
surface in patches which contrast vividly with the surrounding
tones. If the patches are large they will be found to shade off
into green in the centre or at the edges. It should be added
that crackle is almost always present, though it varies much in
intensity and does not seem to have been intentional.</p>

<p>Decoration of any kind is unusual on these wares except on
the large tripod incense burners, which often have slight applied
reliefs in the form of animals, dragons, or peony sprays. Mr.
Freer's dish (Plate 41, Fig. 1) with the raised floral spray is quite
exceptional.</p>

<p>Whatever the verdict may be on the technical qualities of these
rugged pieces as compared with more finely finished porcelain,
there can be no doubt of the artistic merit of the subtle glaze colours,
and I have seen people whose undoubted taste in other forms of
art had not previously been directed to things ceramic, display
a sudden and unexpected enthusiasm over the rough Yüan bowls.
The peculiar shape of these bowls&mdash;which, without their foot take
the form of a half coco&ndash;nut&mdash;has raised the question whether it
can be in any way connected with the Polynesian khava bowls.
The latter are actually made of coco&ndash;nut, and, curiously enough,
their interior after much use acquires a vivid patina, whose colour
recalls some of the Yüan tz´ŭ glazes. The resemblance, however,
remarkable as it is, can only be accidental, for it is practically
certain that the tints of these ceramic glazes were quite unforeseen.
Long use has usually given the surface of the Yüan tz´ŭ
a smooth, worn feeling, but in its first freshness the glaze had
a very high and brilliant lustre. This is shown by a few pieces
which have lately been sent from China, where they were excavated
evidently on the site of the old factory, and still remain in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
seggars or fireclay cases to which they became attached by some
accident in the kiln. These and other spoilt pieces or wasters
would be of immense interest if only the circumstance of their finding
had been faithfully recorded. Unfortunately, however, they
passed through many hands before reaching Europe, and we have
only hearsay to support the statement that they were found in the
neighbourhood of Honan Fu. The locality is a likely enough spot
and not remote from Chün Chou, but we must consider that the
real origin of the Yüan tz´ŭ has yet to be settled, and we must still
remain in doubt whether the ware is a coarse variety of Sung Chün
Chou ware, a continuation of that manufacture in the Yüan
dynasty, or the production of a different factory. Judging from
the character of the glazes, I am inclined to accept the first two
alternatives, which are not mutually exclusive, for while many of
the specimens have the appearance of Sung wares, there is every
reason to suppose that the manufacture continued through the
Yüan period. The formula, "Sung or Yüan ware of Chün type,"
adopted in the catalogue of the exhibition at the Burlington Fine
Arts Club in 1910, is a discreet compromise which may well be
retained till further evidence from China is forthcoming.</p>

<p>The evidence of Sir Aurel Stein's excavations in the regions of
Turfan, imperfect as it is, points to the existence of this kind of
ware at least as early as the Sung dynasty. Fragments with the
typical glaze of the so&ndash;called Yüan&ndash;tz´ŭ were found, for instance,
on a site which was thought to have been closed in the Sung
dynasty, and again at Vash&ndash;shahri, which was "believed to have
been occupied down to the eleventh or twelfth century." Making
ample allowance for error in calculating the dates of these buried
cities, we may still fairly consider that some of these finds come
within the limits of the Sung dynasty.</p>


<p class="p1b"><em>Chien</em> <img src="images/i_130.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>yao</em></p>

<p>This ware, which has already been mentioned in several passages,
originated at Chien&ndash;an, but the factory was subsequently
removed to the neighbouring Chien&ndash;yang. Both places are in the
Chien&ndash;ning Fu, in the province of Fukien, and the term Chien yao
derives from the character <em>chien</em>, which occurs in all these place
names. The beginning of the manufacture is unknown, but it
certainly dates back to the early Sung period, being mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in a tenth&ndash;century work,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and the potteries were still flourishing
at the commencement of the Yüan dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> A characteristic
specimen figured in Plate 42 is a tea bowl with soft, dark brown
earthenware body and thick, lustrous, purplish black glaze, mottled
and streaked with golden brown. The brown forms a solid band
at the mouth and tails off into streaks and drops on the sides, finally
disappearing in a thick mass of black. The spots and streaks of
brown suggested to Chinese writers the markings on a partridge's
breast or on hare's fur, and the bowls are usually known as "hare's
fur cups"<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> or "partridge cups." The dark colour of the glaze
made them specially suitable for the tea&ndash;testing competitions which
were in fashion in the Sung period, the object of the contest being
to see whose tea would stand the largest number of waterings, and
it was found that the least trace of the tea was visible against
the black glaze of the Chien bowls. The testimony of an eleventh&ndash;century
writer<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> on this point is of interest. "The tea," he says,
"is light in colour and suits the black cups. Those made at
Chien&ndash;an are purplish black (<em>kan hei</em>) with markings like hare's
fur. Their material, being somewhat thick, takes long to heat,
and when hot does not quickly cool, which makes them specially
serviceable. No cups from any other place can equal them.
Green (<em>ch´ing</em>) and white cups are not used in the tea&ndash;testing
parties."</p>

<p>The Chinese tea contests were adopted by the Japanese, who
elaborated them into the curious ceremony known as <em>Cha no yu</em>,
which later assumed a semi&ndash;political aspect. The Japanese <em>Cha
jin</em> (initiates of the tea ceremony) have always prized the Chien
yao bowls, to which they gave the name <em>temmoku</em>, and Brinkley
speaks of a great variety of Chien yao glazes which he saw in Japan.
Of some he says that "on a ground of mirror black are seen shifting
tints of purple and blue; reflections of deep green, like the glossy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
colour of the raven's wing; lines of soft silver, regular as hair."
The tea&ndash;testing contests seem to have lost popularity in China
at an early date, and late Ming writers took little interest in the
partridge cups, which one<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> at least of them voted "very inferior."
In Japan, on the other hand, the vogue of the tea ceremonies has
continued unabated to modern times, and no doubt the Chien
bowls were eagerly acquired by the Japanese æsthetes. Hence
their rarity in China to&ndash;day. Moreover, the Japanese potters of
Seto and elsewhere have copied them with astonishing cleverness,
so that the best Seto imitations are exceedingly difficult to distinguish
from the originals. The ordinary run of the Japanese
copies, however, are recognised by a body of lighter tint and finer,
more porcellanous texture, besides their general imitative character
and the Japanese touch which is learnt by observation but
is not easy to define in words.</p>

<p>Though we hear nothing further of this Chien yao after the
Yüan dynasty it is practically certain that the manufacture of
pottery of some sort continued in the district. A small pot of
buff stoneware with a translucent brown glaze (much thinner
than that of the hare's fur bowls and without the purple tint or
the golden brown markings) was found in a tomb near, Chien&ndash;ning
Fu with an engraved slab dated 1560. The find was made
by the Rev. H.S. Phillips, who presented the pot, with a rubbing
of the inscription, to the British Museum.</p>

<p>In addition to the characteristic <em>temmoku</em> we have now quite
a large family of bowls, dishes, jars, and vases with thick purplish
black glazes more or less diversified by golden brown and tea&ndash;dust
green, which are at present grouped with the Chien yao pending
some more precise information as to their origin. They are, however,
distinguished by a coarse porcellanous body of greyish white
or buff colour, and I understand that many of the bowls have come
from excavations in Honan; and there are features in the ornament
and in the ware itself which suggest that they date back as
far as the T´ang period. Fig. 3 of Plate 43, for instance, with its
large brown mottling on a black glaze, is analogous in form and
material to the white&ndash;glazed T´ang wares and in the mottling of
the glaze to the typical T´ang polychrome. The bowls, which are
usually small and shallow with straight sides, wide mouth, and
very narrow foot, or with rounded sides slightly contracting at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
mouth, have neither the weight of material nor smooth solidity of
glaze which characterise the true Chien yao. On the other hand,
they are more varied in the play of black and brown, and in some
cases they have designs and patterns which are clearly intentional.
The two extremes of colour are a monochrome black, usually of
purplish tint but sometimes brownish, and a lustrous brown often
decidedly reddish in tone. Between these come the black glazes
which are more or less variegated with brown in the form of mottling,
streaks, tears, irregular patches, and definite patterns. The glaze
in these bowls usually extends to the foot rim, and sometimes reappears
in a patch under the base. The ornament in some cases
takes the form of rosettes or plum blossom designs in T´ang style
incised through the glaze covering; in others, as in Fig. 1 of
Plate 43, we find a leaf design (evidently stencilled from a real
leaf) expressed in brown or dull tea green; and occasionally there
are more ambitious designs, such as a hare or bird or foliage,
incised. On a red brown bowl in the Museum für Ostasiatische
Kunst at Cologne there are traces of a floral pattern in a lustrous
medium which resembles faded gilding.</p>

<p>We have already noted how the purplish black glaze of the
Tz´ŭ Chou ware breaks into lustrous brown; the black Ting ware
and the debateable red Ting have been discussed; and if we add
this family which may perhaps be provisionally described as Honan
<em>temmoku</em>, it would appear that glazes analogous to those of the
Chien yao "hare's fur" bowls were widely used in Northern China
at an early date.</p>

<p>A word of explanation may appropriately be added here of
the expression <em>wu&ndash;ni yao</em>,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> which occurs in several passages in
Chinese books on pottery. It means "black clay ware," and as
a general term would naturally include the "hare's fur bowls."
Indeed, one passage<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> actually speaks of the <em>wu&ndash;ni yao</em> of Chien&ndash;an,
and the <em>T´ao lu</em>, which gives the ware a paragraph to itself, states
that it was made at Chien&ndash;an, in Chien&ndash;ning Fu, beginning in
the Sung dynasty, and that its clay was black. It further adds
that the glaze is "dry and parched" and that it was sometimes
green (<em>ch´ing</em>). It is clear from the above quotations that <em>wu&ndash;ni
yao</em> was a general expression for the dark&ndash;bodied Chien ware; and
there the matter would have ended had not early works, such
as the <em>Cho kêng lu</em> and <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, mentioned it in the category<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of Kuan and Ko wares, the former naming it with the Hsün
and Yu&ndash;hang wares, which were inferior to the Kuan, and the
latter adding to the passage dealing with Kuan wares the following
note: "There are black wares which are called <em>wu&ndash;ni yao</em>,
all of which were imitated at Lung&ndash;ch´üan. They have no crackle."
The <em>Po wu yao lan</em>, however, explains that these wares "were
admitted <em>by confusion</em> into the category of Kuan and Ko wares,"
and that the "error has been handed down to this day." Probably
it was the green variety which caused the confusion, as there seems
no reason why the black glazes should have been associated with
the Kuan class, though the dark red clay of the Phœnix Hill from
which the Hang Chou Kuan ware was made may have had some
resemblance to the dark red brown body of the Chien yao. As
for the Lung&ndash;ch´üan imitations, we can only imagine that the statement
refers to the later Ko wares, which are said to have been made
with material brought from Hang Chou,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and that their glaze,
too, was of the green variety, as would be expected in the Lung&ndash;ch´üan
district, the home of the green celadons. At the same
time it will be remembered that <em>wu&ndash;ni yao</em> means simply "black
clay ware," and might have been fairly applied to any dark&ndash;bodied
ware wheresoever made.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, many fragments of pottery were included
in the important finds made by Sir Aurel Stein in his excavations
in Turfan. Unfortunately, many of the sites have little
evidential value, because they have clearly been revisited at comparatively
late periods; but there are a few localities which ceased
to be inhabited as early as the Sung dynasty, and which furnished
fragments of glazed pottery and porcellanous wares. I only mention
those sites which, as far as these finds are concerned, were
not vitiated by the occurrence of obviously recent wares. On
one site named Ushaktal, supposed to have been abandoned in
the Sung dynasty, if not before, were fragments of greenish brown
celadon with combed ornament on the body, such as was certainly
made in Corea and probably in China as well. The same site produced
opalescent glazes of the Chün and Yüan type. The site of
Vash&ndash;shahri, which was "occupied probably down to the eleventh
or twelfth century," produced a number of interesting fragments
(1) with buff and grey stoneware bodies and glazes of the opalescent
Chün and Yüan kinds, (2) the same body with emerald green crackled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
glaze, (3) celadon glazes over carved ornament, (4) speckled olive
brown glaze resembling the later "tea dust," (5) opaque dark
brown glaze, (6) speckled dark purplish brown glazes, (7) thick
greenish glaze evenly dappled with pale bluish grey spots.</p>

<p>Early wares found on the mixed sites, such as Kan Chou and Hsi
Yung ch´êng, which were occupied down to Sung times but evidently
visited later, include carved white porcelain and creamy white
ware of the <em>t´u Ting</em> class, and several kinds of <em>Tz´ŭ Chou</em> wares,
the <em>graffiato</em>, as well as the black painted. But evidence from
excavations of this kind is always open to the objection that the
ruins may have been visited later, and the broken pottery dropped
by subsequent explorers. This objection, however, cannot reasonably
be offered to more than a small proportion of the objects found,
and these finds, though not in themselves conclusive, may be
regarded, at any rate, as valuable corroboration of existing theories.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="p6">MIRABILIA</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>ANY strange things are recorded by the early Chinese
writers in connection with pottery and porcelain, and the
tales are solemnly repeated from book to book, though
occasionally a less credulous author adds some such comment as
"This may be true, or, on the other hand, it may not." It is
difficult, however, entirely to discredit the serious and circumstantial
account given by a provincial governor of a curious custom
which prevailed in his district. Fan Ching&ndash;ta, who was appointed
administrator in Kuang&ndash;si in 1172, tells<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> us that "the men of
Nan (&ndash;ning Fu) practise nose&ndash;drinking. They have pottery vessels
such as cups and bowls from the side of which stands up a small
tube like the neck of a bottle. They apply the nose to this tube
and draw up wine or hot fluids, and in the summer months they
drink water. The vessels are called nose&ndash;drinking cups. They say
that water taken through the nose and swallowed is indescribably
delicious. The people of Yung Chou have already recorded the
facts as I have done. They grow a special kind of gourd for the
purpose." Another extract from the same writer's works alludes
to "drums with contracted waist" made of pottery in the villages
of Lin&ndash;kuei and Chih&ndash;t´ien. The village people made a speciality
of the manufacture of this pottery (<em>yao</em>), and baked it to the
correct musical tone. On the glaze, we are told, they painted
red flower patterns by way of ornament. The allusion to painting
in red on the glaze at this early period is interesting, but it is
quite likely that the designs were only in some unfired pigment.</p>

<p>Some of the stories may be regarded merely as figurative descriptions
of the superhuman skill of the artist in rendering "life&ndash;movement."
Thus we are told<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> of "four old porcelain (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) bowls
painted with coloured butterflies. When water was poured in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the butterflies floated on the surface of the water, fluttering about
as if alive." It was an unnatural proceeding for butterflies in any
case, and we can quite understand why "those who saw this, all
maintained secrecy and did not divulge it."</p>

<p>A somewhat similar poetic licence is taken by the same author
in another passage with reference to certain cups and bowls, apparently
of the Sung dynasty, which were found in the K´ang Hsi
period on the site of an old temple. "The bowls had a minute wave
pattern which moved and undulated as in a picture by Wu Tao&ndash;tzŭ.
As for the cups, when a little water was poured into them
four fishes arose out of the sides and swam and dived."</p>

<p>But most curious of all were the Chinese views on the subject
of "furnace transmutations" (<em>yao pien</em>) and the fables which
sprang from them. At the present day the strange behaviour of
metallic oxides, notably copper, under certain firing conditions,
is well known and turned to good account. But in early times,
when the unexpected happened, and a glaze which contained an
infinitesimal quantity of copper oxide was accidentally subjected
to an oxidising or reducing atmosphere in the kiln (by the admission
of air or smoke at the critical moment), instead of coming out a
uniform colour, was streaked and mottled all over with red, green
and blue, or locally splashed with crimson or mixed colour, the
potters saw in the phenomenon something supernatural. It was
a terrifying portent, and on one occasion, we are told, they broke
the wares immediately, and on another they even destroyed the
kilns and fled to another place.</p>

<p>However, the irregular formation of the Chinese kilns greatly
favoured these accidental effects, and in time they became comparatively
common, so that these true "furnace transmutations"
were taken for granted; and though they were not clearly understood
before the end of the K´ang Hsi period, fairly rational explanations
of them were offered by some of the late Ming writers.
Thus the curious splashes of contrasting colour which appeared on
the Kuan, Ko and Chün wares were attributed to the "fire's
magical transmutation."</p>

<p>In these cases only a partial transmutation had taken place,
affecting the glaze alone. But the idea of transmutation in the
fire was carried farther in the Chinese imagination, and stories
grew of cases in which "the vessel throughout was changed and
became wonderful." Su Tung&ndash;p´o has, for instance, left a poem on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a vase organ, in the preface of which it is related<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> that in the
year 1100 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, "while they were drinking at a farewell banquet
to Liu Chi&ndash;chung, they heard the sounds of an organ and flute,"
and that on investigation "it was discovered that the sounds
came out of a pair of vases, and that they stopped when the
meal was over." Another story of the Sung dynasty tells of a
wonderful basin in which the moisture remaining after it had
been emptied displayed, when frozen, a fresh pattern every day.
At first it was a spray of peach blossom, then a branch of peony
with two flowers, then a winter landscape, "with water and
villages of bamboo houses, wild geese flying, and herons standing
upon one leg."</p>

<p>The story of the "self&ndash;warming cups" told by an early Sung
writer<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> evidently belongs to the realm of pure fiction: "In the
treasury of T´ien Pao (742 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>) there were green (<em>ch´ing</em>) ware
(<em>tz´ŭ</em>) wine cups with markings like tangled silk. They were thin
as paper. When wine was poured into them it gradually grew
warm. Then it had the appearance of steaming, and next of boiling.
Hence the name 'self&ndash;warming cups.'"</p>

<p>Scarcely less marvellous is the incident recorded in the <em>Yü
chang ta shih chi</em>, written about 1454.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> "At the time when the
temple of the god (of pottery) was in existence, an Imperial order
was given to Ching&ndash;tê Chên to make a wind&ndash;screen; but it was
not successful, and was changed in the kiln into a bed six feet long
and one foot high. At the second attempt it was again changed
and became a boat three feet long. Inside the boat were the various
fittings all complete. The officials of the prefecture and district
all saw it. But it was pounded to pieces with a pestle, for they
did not dare to let it go to court." Another story<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> tells how Chia
and I (John Doe and Richard Roe) when hunting were led in pursuit
of a wounded hare into an ancient tomb in the mountains,
where they found a large jar containing two white porcelain vases
and an ink slab. Chia broke one of the vases, but I stopped any
further vandalism and carried the other specimens home. He
used the vase for flowers, but for several days he noticed "an,
emanation from within issuing from the <em>Yin yün</em> (generative power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of nature) like a vapour of cloud." Being puzzled, he tried plucking
the stalks of the flowers, and "found that they contained no
moisture, and yet the plants did not wither. Moreover, the buds
kept strong, as if they had rooted in the clay of the vase. So he
began to be astonished at the vase, regarding it as a kind of <em>yao
pien</em>. One day, during a great storm of wind and rain, suddenly
there was a flash and a peal of thunder, and the vase was shaken
to pieces. I was very much alarmed and distressed."</p>

<p>The <em>Yang hsien ming hu hsi</em> speaks of instances in which the
Yi&ndash;hsing teapots were affected in a peculiar way, the ware changing
from drab to rosy red when filled with tea; and we have already
seen that Hsiang Yüan&ndash;p'ien illustrates in his Album examples of
this, which he solemnly assures us he would not have believed
had he not seen it happen before his eyes. In all these cases
the ware was supposed to have been completely changed in the
kiln and to have acquired supernatural properties. "The magic
of the god had entered into the ware in the firing and had not
left it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="p6">PORCELAIN AND ITS BEGINNINGS</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE reader will have noticed that the word porcelain, which
was avoided in the discussion of the earlier periods, has
insensibly crept into the chapters which deal with the Sung
wares. It was no longer right or proper that it should be excluded,
and it is high time that our attitude on the interesting
question of its origin was defined. Unfortunately, that attitude
is still&mdash;and must necessarily remain&mdash;one of doubt and uncertainty,
but we can at least clear away some of the existing misapprehensions
on the subject.</p>

<p>The myth which carried back the manufacture of porcelain
some eighteen centuries before our era has been definitely discredited,
and the snuff bottles supposed to have been found in
ancient Egyptian tombs which gave rise to the idea are now known
to be of quite modern make. The more modest computation which
placed the invention in the Han dynasty (206 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span> to 220 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>)
might have been almost as lightly dismissed had not Dr. Bushell,
after disposing of the theory in his <em>Oriental Ceramic Art</em><a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> in 1899,
seen fit to reverse his decision in later publications.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>The reasons given for this later attitude are on the surface so
convincing that it is necessary to consider them in detail and to
examine the authorities on which they are based. Bushell's statement
runs as follows: "It is generally agreed that porcelain was
first made in China, but authorities differ widely in fixing a date
for its invention. The Chinese attribute its invention to the Han
dynasty, when a new character <em>tz'ŭ</em> was coined to designate, presumably,
a new substance. The official memoir on 'Porcelain
Administration' in the topography of Fou&ndash;liang, the first edition of
which was published in 1270, says that according to local tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the ceramic works at Hsin&ndash;p'ing (an old name of Fou&ndash;liang) were
founded in the time of the Han dynasty, and had been in constant
operation ever since. This is confirmed by T'ang Ying, the
celebrated superintendent of the Imperial potteries, appointed in
1728, who states in his autobiography that the result of his researches
shows that porcelain was first made during the Han
dynasty at Ch'ang&ndash;nan (Ching&ndash;tê Chên), in the district of Fou&ndash;liang."</p>

<p>From this and the passages immediately following it is clear
that Bushell at that time leant strongly to the Han theory, which
he had previously discarded, for three reasons, which we shall now
examine. The first rests on the character <em>tz'ŭ</em>. Whether the
character <em>tz'ŭ</em> was coined to designate a new substance in the Han
dynasty is by no means certain. It undoubtedly appears in the
Han dictionary, the <em>Shuo Wên</em>, but with the meagre definition
"pottery ware,"<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and without any further indication of its nature.
The second is based on a passage in the Annals of Fou&ndash;liang, which
on examination proves to contain only the general word <em>t'ao</em> (ware)
and not the character <em>tz'ŭ</em> at all. The actual passage runs: "The
manufacture of pottery (<em>t'ao</em>) at Hsin&ndash;p'ing began in the Han
dynasty. Speaking generally, this pottery was strong, heavy, and
coarse, being fashioned of rich clay with moisture added, after
methods handed down from the ancients." The third invokes
the authority of T'ang Ying, but on reference to the autobiography
of this distinguished ceramist in the <em>Chiang hsi t'ung chih</em>, we again
find reference only to <em>t'ao</em> and not to <em>tz'ŭ</em>, viz. "It (<em>t'ao</em>) is not the
growth of one day. Research shows that it began in the Han
dynasty and was transmitted through succeeding generations. Its
place (of manufacture) changed (from time to time), but it flourished
at Ch'ang&ndash;nan." One obvious place for T'ang's research would
be the Annals of Fou&ndash;liang, and I shrewdly suspect that his conclusions
were based on the very passage quoted above, of which
his words give a clear echo. But in any case, neither passage has
any bearing on the origin of porcelain unless we assume that <em>t'ao</em>
is the same as <em>tz'ŭ</em>, and that both words definitely mean <em>porcelain</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
an assumption which is not only quite unwarranted but in any
case begs the whole question.</p>

<p>The Chinese words used at the present day for porcelain are
<em>tz'ŭ</em>, <em>t'ao</em>, and <em>yao</em>, all of considerable antiquity, though their forms
have undergone various changes and their meaning has been
modified from time to time to keep pace with the evolution of the
ware. The word <em>tz'ŭ</em> <img src="images/i_142a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, as we have seen, was defined in the Han
dictionary as merely "pottery ware." Its modern definition is
a hard, fine&ndash;grained variety of <em>t'ao</em>, and if we add to this the quality
of resonance&mdash;i.e. of emitting a musical note when struck&mdash;we
have all the requirements of porcelain according to the Chinese
definition. The synonym <img src="images/i_142b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, containing the radical <img src="images/i_142c.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>shih</em> (a
stone), which is also pronounced <em>tz'ŭ</em>, has come in the last two
centuries to be used interchangeably with the older word <img src="images/i_142d.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, in
spite of the protests of eighteenth&ndash;century purists.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The word <em>t'ao</em> <img src="images/i_142e.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> is a term even more comprehensive than our
word "china." In the Han dictionary it appeared in the form <img src="images/i_142f.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />
<em>t'ao</em> or <em>yao</em> (previously pronounced <em>fou</em>), composed of <img src="images/i_142g.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>fou</em> (earthenware)
and the radical <img src="images/i_142h.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>pao</em> (to wrap), and its meaning was <em>kiln</em>,
and by extension the <em>products of the kiln</em>. At that time the word
in its modern form was only used as a proper name.</p>

<p>The third character <em>yao</em> (the Japanese <em>yaki</em>) is precisely synonymous
with <em>t'ao</em>, meaning first a <em>kiln</em> and then <em>wares</em> of any kind.
In its form <img src="images/i_142i.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> it occurs in the Han dictionary; another form is <img src="images/i_142j.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />,
which, according to a Sung writer,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> dates from the T'ang period,
and a third form <img src="images/i_142k.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> is current in modern dictionaries.</p>

<p>In short, the Chinese terms are all of a general and comprehensive
kind, capable of embracing pottery, stoneware, and porcelain
impartially, and there is no single Chinese word which corresponds
to our precise term "porcelain." Under these circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
it is clear that no theory on the origin of porcelain can be based
merely on the occurrence of any of these words in early Chinese
texts. Still less can any such theory be constructed from the very
promiscuous use of the word "porcelain" in European translations,
and it is a thousand pities that both Julien and Bushell were not
more discriminating in this matter, or that they did not always
(as Julien sometimes and Professor Hirth usually did) give the
Chinese character in parentheses when any reasonable doubt could
exist. Had this been done we should have been spared misleading
references to "two porcelain cups of the Han dynasty,"<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and such
loose writing<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> as "In the Wei dynasty (221&ndash;264 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>) which succeeded
the Han we read of a glazed celadon ware made at Lo Yang
for the use of the palace, and in the Chin dynasty (265&ndash;419) we
have the first mention of blue porcelain produced at Wên&ndash;chou,
in the province of Chehkiang, the progenitor of the sky&ndash;blue glazes
tinted with cobalt, which afterwards became so famous." The
"glazed celadon," needless to say, is purely conjectural, pottery
(<em>t'ao</em>) vessels being all that is specified in the passage on which
the statement is obviously based; and the "blue porcelain" is
evidently no other than the <em>p'iao tz'ŭ</em> (mentioned by the poet
P'an Yo and discussed on p. 16), which is better rendered "green
ware."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The same kind of criticism applies to all the other references
in early writers until we reach the Sui dynasty (581&ndash;617 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>). In
the annals of this period there is a much discussed passage in which
it is stated that the art of making a substance known as <em>liu&ndash;li</em><a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
had been lost in China, and that the workmen did not dare to experiment,
but that one Ho Ch'ou <img src="images/i_143a.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />, a connoisseur in pictures
and antiquities, succeeded in making it with green ware (<em>lü tz'ŭ</em>),
and that his imitations were not distinguishable from the original
substance.</p>

<p>To understand the full import of this passage it is necessary
to explain the nature of <em>liu&ndash;li</em>, and this is fortunately made quite
clear by the author of the <em>T'ao shuo</em> in a commentary so interesting
that I give it in full:</p>

<p>"I find that <em>liu&ndash;li</em> comes from the countries of Huang&ndash;chih,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Ssŭ&ndash;t'iao and Jih&ndash;nan.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> That produced in Ta&ndash;ch'in (the eastern
provinces of the Roman Empire) is in ten colours&mdash;pink, white,
black, yellow, blue, green, deep purple, deep blue (or green), red,
and brown. <em>Liu&ndash;li</em> was originally a natural substance.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Yen
Shih&ndash;ku,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> commenting in the Annals of the Han Dynasty, says,
'At the present time they commonly use molten stones, adding
a number of chemicals and then pouring the substance (into moulds)
and forming it; but it is unsubstantial, brittle, and not a successful
casting.' In the Northern Wei dynasty, in the reign of T'ai Wu
(424&ndash;451 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), a man of the Ta Yüeh&ndash;chih<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> who came to trade at
the capital, said he could make <em>liu&ndash;li</em> by melting stones. Eventually
he collected the ore and made it (<em>liu&ndash;li</em>), and the finished article
surpassed the original in its brilliance and colour. The method
has been handed down to the present day, and it was probably
only an accidental intermission which occurred in the Sui dynasty.
But the Chinese castings are brittle in substance, and when hot
wine is poured into them they fly to pieces in the hand. What a
pity the Yüeh&ndash;chih method has been handed down instead of
Ch'ou's!"</p>

<p>The allusions to melting stones, casting, etc., in this passage
leave no doubt that the <em>liu&ndash;li</em>, as made in China, was a kind of glass,
imitating a natural stone.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> It is, in fact, usually translated in
the dictionaries as "opaque glass," and in connection with pottery
it has the sense of glaze&mdash;e.g. <em>liu li wa</em> "glazed pottery."</p>

<p>We can now return to Ho Ch'ou, who "took green ware and
made <em>liu&ndash;li</em>."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> It has been thought that what he made must
have been a kind of porcelain, but there is no indication of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
such achievement, for though it is possible to make an artificial
porcelain with glass as a constituent, the converse is not true:
you cannot make glass out of either pottery or porcelain. The
most probable explanation of the passage seems to be that Ho
Ch´ou (who was apparently not a potter) experimented at some
pottery with the materials used in glazing the green ware, and
found that he could make a very good glass (<em>liu&ndash;li</em>) with the potter's
green glaze, and perhaps other ingredients, a result which is in
no way surprising, seeing that the softer ceramic glazes have a
very close affinity to glass. But no further inferences can be drawn
from this passage, and it is not even clear that Ho Ch´ou made a
ceramic ware at all. All we are told is that he made <em>liu&ndash;li</em>. I have
rather laboured this negative point, because Professor Zimmermann
has published a declaration of belief that Ho Ch´ou was the
discoverer of porcelain.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Apart from the obvious criticism which
the writer himself anticipates, that such an epoch&ndash;making discovery
would hardly have escaped the notice of Ho Ch´ou's biographer,
Professor Zimmermann opens his case with a fundamental
error, for which he has to thank Dr. Bushell. It is true that he
only names Julien as the source of his information, but his version
of the story of Ho Ch´ou is taken verbatim from Bushell's <em>Oriental
Ceramic Art</em>,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> where the crucial passage is unfortunately rendered
"but he (Ho Ch´ou) succeeded in making vessels of green porcelain
which could not be distinguished from true glass." This mistranslation
puts an entirely different complexion on the passage,
and goes a long way to justify Professor Zimmermann's inferences
that Ch´ou made a glassy ware of the nature of porcelain. It is
an instructive instance of the pitfalls which beset the student of
Chinese subjects, especially when he has to rely on other people's
translations.</p>

<p>Strange to say, a similar mistranslation occurs in Dr. Hirth's
short but excellent treatise on <em>Ancient Chinese Porcelain</em>,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> in a
passage which is nevertheless of great importance to our quest.
It has been the custom with Chinese compilers of reference works
to incorporate the material of previous editions, adding their own
commentaries and any further information which happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have reached them, and to this we are indebted for the preservation
of many passages from ancient writers which would otherwise
be extremely difficult of access. Thus Hirth found embalmed
in the Sung Pharmacopœia two early references to the material
<em>pai o</em> <img src="images/i_146a.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> which he shows to be without doubt the kaolinic earth
used in the manufacture of porcelain, and which, like many other
strange materials, entered into Chinese medicinal prescriptions.
The first mention of this substance is taken from the writings of
T´ao Yin&ndash;chü, who died in 536 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, to the effect that the <em>pai o</em>,
besides being used in medicines, was employed at that time for
painting pictures; and Hirth argues that so celebrated a writer
on scientific subjects as T´ao Yin&ndash;chü could not have failed to note
it if the <em>pai o</em> had been in general use for ceramic purposes as well.
This is followed by a quotation from the T´ang Pharmacopœia
(compiled about 650 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>): "It (<em>pai o</em>) is now used for painter's
work, and rarely enters into medicinal prescriptions; during recent
generations it has been prepared from white ware<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> (<em>tz´ŭ</em>)." By
rendering the last sentence "during recent generations it has been
used to make white porcelain," Hirth invested the passage with a
greater interest than it actually possesses. But even when stripped
of this fictitious importance, it constitutes the first literary evidence
we have of the use of kaolin by Chinese potters. This is followed
by another quotation from the T´ang Pharmacopœia recommending
for medicinal purposes a powder prepared from the white ware of
Ting Chou.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Whether we are to understand that the Chinese pharmacist
ground up broken pieces of Ting ware or merely made use of the
refined and purified clay obtained at the potteries, matters little.
Neither proceeding would be without parallel in Europe in far
later times than the T´ang period. But the specific reference to
white Ting ware at this early date is most interesting in view of
the fact that Ting Chou was celebrated in the Sung dynasty for
a white ware which is undoubtedly a kind of porcelain.</p>

<p>The presence of a kaolin&ndash;like material in a dark&ndash;coloured ware,
probably of the third century, which was disclosed by the analysis
made by Mr. Nicholls in Chicago, has already been recorded (p.
15). We have no means of ascertaining what length of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
elapsed before a white material of this nature was evolved, but
it was clearly in existence in the beginning of the sixth century.
Possibly it was not porcelain according to the strict European
definition, but there is every reason to suppose that it was a hard
white ware, such as the Chinese would not hesitate to include in
their porcelain category. Such a ware appears on some of the
funeral vases which may safely be referred to the early T´ang period
(see p. 26), and in default of other evidence I think we can say
that porcelain in the Chinese sense already existed at the end of
the Sui dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Though this period happens to coincide with the lifetime of
Ho Ch´ou, neither his name nor any other has been associated
with the event by the Chinese, and it is highly probable that porcelain
only came into being by a process of evolution from pottery
and stoneware, the critical moment arriving with the discovery of
deposits of kaolinic earth. As a mere speculation, I would suggest
that the deposits were those at Han tan, the modern Tz´ŭ Chou,
which supplied material for the Ting Chou potters.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> It is, at any
rate, significant that the new name, which we are led to suppose
was derived from the <em>tz´ŭ</em> stone,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> was given to that place in the
Sui dynasty.</p>

<p>Numerous literary references from this time onwards have
already been quoted which are highly suggestive of porcelain. The
"false jade vessels" of T´ao Yü in the early years of the seventh
century; the eighth&ndash;century tea bowls of Yu Chou and Hsing
Chou which were compared respectively to jade and ice, to silver
and snow, the former being green and the latter white. The
twelve cups used for musical chimes by Kuo Tao&ndash;yüan; the white
bowls immortalised by the poet Tu "of ware (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) baked at
Ta&ndash;yi, light but strong, which gives out a note like jade when
struck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The quality of translucency which in Europe<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> is regarded as
distinctive of porcelain is never emphasised in Chinese descriptions.
I can find no mention of it in any of the earlier writings,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
and the first unmistakable literary evidence of its existence<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> comes
from a foreign source. The Arab traveller, Soleyman, who describes
his experiences in China in the ninth century, states that "they
had a fine clay (<em>ghādar</em>) from which bowls were made, and in the
transparency of the vessels the light of the water was visible; and
they were (made of) fine clay."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This statement practically proves
the existence of translucent porcelain in the T´ang dynasty, and
we confidently await the arrival of specimens from Chinese excavations.
Some of the export porcelains of the time have been
actually unearthed at Samarra on the Euphrates by Professor
Sarre,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> of the Kaiser Friederik Museum, Berlin, and they include
(1) bowls of gummy white porcelain with unglazed gritty base;
(2) greenish white ware; (3) yellowish white with small crackle;
and (4) a pure white porcelain with relief designs, such as birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and fishes, under the glaze. Other pottery found on that site
included mottled ware of typical T´ang type, and a creamy white
of the Tz´ŭ Chou type with brown spots.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>From considerations of form and the general character of the
ware, I am inclined to regard three specimens in Plates 44 and
45 as belonging to the T´ang period. Fig. 1 of Plate 44 has a
thin ivory white glaze running in gummy drops and clouded with
pinkish buff staining outside and with a reddish discoloration within.
Fig. 2 of the same Plate is remarkable in many ways. It is so thin
as to seem to consist of little else but glaze, and is consequently
almost as translucent as glass. The colour of the glaze is pearly
white powdered with tiny specks, and the crackle is clearly marked.
The base is flat and discloses a dry white body of fine grain. But
its most conspicuous feature is the arresting beauty of its outline,
which recalls some choice specimen of Græco&ndash;Roman glass,
and displays a classic feeling frequently observed in T´ang pottery
and in the Corean wares which owe so much to T´ang models.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, Plate 45, shows the celebrated phœnix ewer belonging
to Mr. Eumorfopoulos which has proved so difficult to classify.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
It is a white porcellanous ware translucent in the thinner parts,
and the glaze is of light greenish grey with a tendency to blue in
places. The form and ornament show strong analogies with specimens
of T´ang pottery. The neck, for instance, may be compared
with Fig. 2 of Plate 14; the phœnix head and the foliate
mouth with Fig. 1 of Plate 9, and the carved ornament on the
body with Fig. 3 of Plate 14.</p>

<p>Among the Sung wares many of the white Ting specimens are
found to be translucent in their thinner parts, and these may be
fairly regarded as porcelain proper. A considerable number of
other white porcelains have come over of late under the description
of Sung wares, and many of them are certainly early enough in
form and style to belong to that period. They are true hard porcelain,
translucent, and of a creamy white colour. Being for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
most part without decoration, they can only be judged by their
forms, and in view of the conservative habits of the Chinese,
it would be rash to assert too emphatically their Sung origin.
Yüan and even early Ming dates are suggested by the more
cautious critics; but the possibility of a Sung origin having been
established, I am inclined to give the evidence of form its full
weight.</p>

<p>There are, besides these, other well&ndash;defined types of translucent
porcelain which may confidently be attributed to a period
as early as the Sung, but here the possibility&mdash;nay, probability&mdash;of
a Corean origin has to be considered. It is certain that many
of them have been found in Corean tombs; the provenance of the
rest is doubtful. One type is a delicious smooth white porcelain
with glaze of faintly bluish tinge, highly translucent, and worked
very thin at the edges. The base of the vessels (usually small
shallow bowls or saucers) is unglazed, and shows a soft&ndash;looking
sugary body of close texture, rather earthy than glassy, and slightly
browned by the fire. They have, in fact, almost the appearance
of a "soft&ndash;paste" porcelain like that of Chelsea. These are so
different from any known Chinese type that I strongly incline to
a Corean origin for them. Another type is of hard but translucent
ware with glaze of distinctly bluish tinge. A bowl in the
British Museum is a good example of this. Of the usual conical
form, it has a plain outside, and the inside is decorated with an
incised design of not very clear meaning, but apparently a close
foliage ground with highly formalised figures of boys. If this
interpretation is correct, it is a conventional rendering of the well&ndash;known
pattern of boys in foliage, Chinese in origin, but frequently
used by the Corean potters. The design ends in Corean fashion,
about an inch below the rim, leaving a plain band above it. The
glaze is a faint bluish colour all over, and is powdered with specks,
a fault in the firing; the base is almost entirely unglazed, and
the biscuit, where exposed, has turned reddish brown. The style
of this piece is strongly Corean. The same peculiarities in the
base are shared by another type of small bowl, usually decorated
inside with a sketchy design in combed lines. Some of these are
creamy white; others are bluish white with a decided blue tinge
in the well of the bowl where the glaze has formed thickly.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Another
group, which is also said to be represented among the Corean tomb
wares, is practically indistinguishable from the creamy white Ting
Chou porcelain.</p>

<p>The whole question of these interesting porcelains is complicated
by the fact that the Coreans were admittedly indebted to the Ting
Chou potters for many of their designs;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and by the fact that
while close intercourse between China and Corea existed the Coreans
may well have imported Chinese wares and deposited some of them
in the tombs. An authentic find of these porcelains in a Chinese
tomb would give important evidence on this point, but so far there
is no evidence of their being found in China beyond the statement
of traders, and it is quite certain that they have been found in
Corean tombs. It may be added that the Japanese class them
as <em>hakugorai</em> or white Corean ware, and stoutly support their Corean
origin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="p6">CHING&ndash;TÊ CHÊN</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">C</span>HING&ndash;TÊ CHÊN, the metropolis of the ceramic world, whose
venerable and glorious traditions outshine Meissen and
Sèvres and all the little lights of Europe, and leave them
eclipsed and obscure, is an unwalled town or mart (<em>chên</em>) on the
left bank of the Ch´ang River, which flows into the Po&ndash;yang Lake,
on the northern border of the province of Kiangsi. In ancient
times it was known as Ch´ang&ndash;nan Chên, the mart on the south
of the Ch´ang, but when the Sung Emperor Chên Tsung commanded
that officially manufactured porcelain (<em>kuan chih tz´ŭ</em>)
should be sent to the capital, and that the workmen should inscribe
the pieces with the <em>nien hao</em> or name of the period, which
in this case was Ching Tê (1004&ndash;1007), the name of the place
was changed to Ching&ndash;tê Chên.</p>

<p>The district town is Fou&ndash;liang, seven miles higher up the river,
a place of relatively small importance, but the residence of the
district magistrate; and both Fou&ndash;liang and Ching&ndash;tê Chên are
within the prefectural jurisdiction of Jao Chou Fu, which is situated
near the mouth of the Ch´ang.</p>

<p>The wares of Ching&ndash;tê Chên are distributed by various routes,
some overland to Chi&ndash;mên or to Wu&ndash;yuan and thence to Hang
Chou, Su Chou, Shanghai, etc.; the rest by boat down the Ch´ang,
and thence either to Kiu&ndash;kiang on the Yangtze for further dispatch
to Chin&ndash;kiang and northwards via the Grand Canal, or to the south&ndash;west
corner of the lake and up the estuary of the Kan River to
Nan&ndash;Ch´ang Fu. From this latter town they could be carried by
water (with an interruption of thirty miles of road) all the way
to Canton. They are known under various names in Chinese
books&mdash;Chên yao, Ching&ndash;tê yao, Fou&ndash;liang yao, Jao Chou yao,
Jao yao, Ch´ang&ndash;nan yao, and Nan&ndash;ch´ang yao&mdash;all of which are
easily explicable from the foregoing paragraph.</p>

<p>The old name of Fou&ndash;liang was Hsin&ndash;p´ing, and according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the Annals of Fou&ndash;liang the manufacture of pottery<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> was traditionally
held to have begun in the district of Hsin&ndash;p´ing in the
Han dynasty. In the same passage the development of the local
industry is traced by means of a few significant incidents. In
the first year of Chih Tê in the Ch´ên dynasty (583 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>) the potters
of the district were called upon to provide plinths for the Imperial
buildings at Chien&ndash;k´ang (afterwards Nanking), but the plinths,
when finished, though cleverly made, were not strong enough to
carry the weight of the columns. In the fourth (or, according to
another reading, the second) year of Wu Tê of the T´ang dynasty
(621 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>), "porcelain jade"<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> was offered as tribute to the Emperor
under the name of false jade vessels (<em>chia yü ch´i</em>), and from this
time forward the duty (of supplying the Emperor) became an
institution,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and a potter named Ho Chung&ndash;ch´u gained a great
reputation. In the Ching Tê period of the Sung dynasty, as
already stated, officially manufactured porcelain was sent to the
capital, where it supplied the needs of the palaces and great
establishments. In the T´ai Ting period of the Yüan dynasty
(1324&ndash;1327) the porcelain factory came under the inspection of
the Intendant of the Circuit, who supplied the required wares
when orders had been received, and closed the factory if there
were no orders (from the Court).</p>

<p>Continuing into the Ming dynasty, the same authority gives
details of the various administrative changes which may perhaps be
"taken as read," one or two important facts only calling for mention.
Thus in the thirty&ndash;fifth year<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> of Hung Wu, we are told that
the factories were opened, and that supplies of porcelain were sent
to the Court. There seems to have been some difference of opinion
about the building of the Imperial Ware Factory (<em>Yü ch´i ch´ang</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Some authorities place this event in the Hung Wu period, but
the <em>Chiang hsi t´ung chih</em>,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> though quoting the other opinions in
a note, mentions only the building of the Imperial Factory in the
reign of Chêng Tê (1506&ndash;1521) in the main text, viz.: "In the beginning
of the Chêng Tê period the Imperial Ware Factory was
established for dealing specially with the Imperial wares." The
Imperial establishment was burnt down in the Wan Li period, and
again destroyed in the revolt of Wu San&ndash;kuei in 1675, but the most
serious blow dealt to the prosperity of Ching&ndash;tê Chên fell in the
T´ai p´ing rebellion in 1853, when the town was sacked and almost
depopulated. The Imperial Factory was rebuilt in 1864, and the
industry has in a great measure revived, though it is still but the
shadow of its former greatness.</p>

<p>Though this great porcelain town has traded with the whole
world for several centuries, "bringing great profit to the Empire
and to itself great fame" (to quote from the <em>T´ao lu</em>), it seems to
have been rarely visited by Europeans, and first&ndash;hand descriptions
of it are few. We are fortunate, however, in possessing in the
letters<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> of Père d'Entrecolles an intimate account of the place
and its manufactures, written by a Jesuit missionary who was
stationed in the town in the early years of the eighteenth century.
These interesting letters are so well known that I shall not quote
them extensively here. The picture they give of the enormous
pottery town, with its population of a million souls and the three
thousand furnaces which, directly or indirectly, provided a living
for this host, and of the arresting spectacle of the town by night
like a burning city spouting flames at a thousand points, a description
which inspired the oft&ndash;quoted lines in Longfellow's "Keramos,"
shows us the place in the heyday of its prosperity.</p>

<p>A more modern but scarcely less interesting account of Ching&ndash;tê
Chên and the surrounding country appears in a Consular report,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
made in 1905, of a <em>Journey in the Interior of Kiangsi</em>,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> from which
I have taken the following paragraphs:</p>

<p>"During the last forty&ndash;five years Ching&ndash;tê Chên has had time
to recover, in a very large measure, from this last calamity, but
it is said to be not so busy or so populous as before the T´ai p´ing
rebellion.</p>

<p>"Everything in Ching&ndash;tê Chên either belongs to, or is altogether
subordinate to, the porcelain and earthenware industry. The very
houses are for the most part built of fragments of fireclay (called
'<em>lo&ndash;p´ing&ndash;t´u</em>') that were once part either of old kilns or of the
fireclay covers in which porcelain is stacked during firing. The
river bank is covered for miles<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> with a deep stratum of broken
chinaware and chips of fireclay, and, as far as one could judge,
the greater part of the town and several square miles of the surrounding
country are built over, or composed of, a similar deposit.
A great industry, employing hundreds of thousands of hands, does
not remain localised in a single spot for 900 years without giving
to that spot a character of its own.</p>

<p>"This is perhaps what struck me most forcibly in Ching&ndash;tê Chên&mdash;that
it is unlike anything else in China. The forms, the colour,
the materials used in the buildings, the atmosphere, are somewhat
reminiscent of the poorer parts of Manchester, but resemble
no other large town that I have ever visited.</p>

<p>"At present there are 104 pottery kilns in the town, of which
some thirty or so were actually in work at the time of my visit.
The greater part of the kilns only work for a comparatively short
season every&ndash;summer. During this busy season, when every kiln
is perhaps employing an average of 100 to 200 men, the population
of Ching&ndash;tê Chên rises to about 400,000, but of this nearly, if not
quite, half are labourers drawn from a wide area of country, chiefly
from the Tuch´ang district, who only come for the season, live
in rows of barrack&ndash;like sheds, and do not bring their families with
them."</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare this modern account with the
Memoirs of Chiang,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> written in the Yüan dynasty, from which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
see that the work was carried on in the same intermittent fashion,
the potters receiving land to cultivate instead of payment, living
round the master of the pottery, and being liable to be summoned
to the kilns when required. The opening of the kilns in those days
was in some measure dependent on the success of the harvest, and
in any case the work depended on the season, as the paste would
freeze in winter, and could not be worked.</p>

<p>The hills which surround Ching&ndash;tê Chên are rich in the materials
required by the potters, china clay and china stone of various
qualities, fireclay for the seggars (cases to protect the porcelain
in the kiln), or for mixing in the coarser wares, and numerous other
minerals. There was water&ndash;power which could be used in the
mills for crushing and refining the minerals, and abundant wood
for firing. Although coal is worked nowadays not many miles
away, the potters still adhere to the wood, which has served their
kilns from time immemorial. It should be added that at the present
day&mdash;and no doubt for some time past&mdash;the local clays have been
supplemented from various districts, supplies coming overland
from Chi&ndash;mên and by water from greater distances.</p>

<p>A good Chinese map of Ching&ndash;tê Chên is given in the <em>T´ao lu</em>
(bk. i., fol. 1), and a large map of the district is attached to Mr.
W. Clennell's report, which is easily obtainable.</p>

<p>This description of Ching&ndash;tê Chên has led us far from the period
with which we are at present concerned. In the Sung dynasty
the place had already arrived at considerable importance, and
the record of its 300 kilns implies a very large population. The
excellence of its porcelain had already won for it the onerous privilege
of supplying Imperial needs, and, as we have seen, it was consecrated
under the new and Imperial name of Ching&ndash;tê Chên in
the opening years of the eleventh century. The earliest existing
record of its productions, the Memoirs of Chiang, written at the
beginning of the fourteenth century, tells us that the Sung porcelains
made at Ching&ndash;tê Chên were pure white<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and without a flaw,
and were carried for sale to all parts under the proud name of "Jao
Chou jade." It rivalled the "red porcelain" of Chên&ndash;ting Fu
and the green of Lung&ndash;ch´üan in beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> describes the Imperial ware of this time as
"thin in body and lustrous," and mentions "plain white pieces
with contracted waist," adding that the specimens "with unglazed
rim,"<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> though thin in body, white in colour, lustrous, and surpassingly
beautiful, are lower in price than the Ting wares.</p>

<p>It is not too much to assume that some of this "Jao Chou jade"
has survived to the present day, and we may look for it among
the early translucent white porcelains, of which a considerable number
have reached Europe during the last few years. Many of these have
Sung forms and the Sung style, though, of course, plain white wares
are always difficult to date. In the specimens to which I refer
the glaze is usually of a warm ivory tone, tending to cream colour;
it is hard and usually discontinued in the region of the base, both
underneath and on the side, and the exposed body is rather rough
to the touch. (See Plate 24, Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>It is not clear whether we are to infer from the comparison with
Lung&ndash;ch´üan ware quoted above that the Ching&ndash;tê Chên potters
produced a celadon in the Sung dynasty, but it is probable enough
that they did so, and that the green or greenish white (<em>ch´ing pai</em>)<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
made in the Yüan period was a continuation of this. If we can
believe the statement in the <em>T´ao lu</em>, they began early to copy the
wares of other factories, imitating the Chün Chou ware at the end
of the Sung period and the crackled Chi Chou ware in the Yüan.</p>

<p>It seems to me possible that the reference to the imitation of
Chün ware may be explained by an interesting passage from a late
twelfth&ndash;century<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> writer quoted in the <em>T´ao lu</em>, who says that in the
Ta Kuan period (1107&ndash;1110) there were among the Ching&ndash;tê Chên
wares "furnace transmutations" (<em>yao pien</em>) in colour red like
cinnabar.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> He is inclined to attribute this phenomenon to the
fact that "when the planet Mars in the Zodiac approaches its
greatest brightness, then things happen magically and contrary
to the usual order." The potters were evidently disturbed by
the appearance of the wares, and broke them. He tells us, further,
that he stayed at Jao Chou and obtained a number of specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
(of the local ware), and after examining them he could say that,
"compared with the red porcelain (<em>hung tz´ŭ</em>) of Ting Chou,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> they
were more fresh and brilliant in appearance." It will be remembered
that an echo of this last sentence occurred in the Memoirs
of Chiang.</p>

<p>A passage in the <em>Po wu yao lan</em><a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> might be taken to mean that
blue&ndash;painted porcelain, "blue and white," was made at Ching&ndash;tê
Chên prior to the Yüan period, but as the remainder of the sentence
seems to be based on the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, and no evidence is given
for the words in question, too much importance need not be attached
to a phrase which may be a confusion arising from the
<em>ch´ing pai</em> of earlier writers.</p>

<p class="p6">THE YÜAN <img src="images/i_159.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="Chinese character" /> DYNASTY, 1280&ndash;1367 A.D.</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE Yüan dynasty, which lasted from 1280 to 1367, was established
by Kublai Khan, grandson of the great Mongol conqueror,
Genghis Khan. The Mongols completely subjugated
China, and though their rule was comparatively brief, it had a
disastrous effect on the artistic development of the country. The
Mongol governors whose services to the reigning house had been
rewarded by all the lucrative posts, made full use of their opportunities
to enrich themselves by extortion and oppression. Trade
and industry were convenient subjects for their exactions, and
these consequently languished. The ceramic industry was among
the sufferers, and many of the old potteries were closed down in this
troubled period. The potteries at Ching&ndash;tê Chên, which had gradually
risen to a position of great importance in the Sung dynasty,
suffered for this eminence by being brought under the immediate
care of a Mongol commissioner, and much of their trade passed into
the hands of manufacturers in Kiangsi and Fukien.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The earliest
account<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> which we have of the industry in this important centre,
written at the beginning of the fourteenth century, ends with a
bitter cry against the depredations of the governors and the subordinate
officials, who were banded together to rob the people,
and against whom no redress could be obtained. Dr. Bushell
published a translation of the chief part of it in <em>Oriental Ceramic
Art</em>,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and apart from the sorrowful picture which it draws it gives
a good idea of the productions of the district in the Yüan dynasty.
A short notice in the <em>T´ao lu</em> gives a slightly different impression,
and leads us to suppose that the heavy hand of the Mongol officials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was felt chiefly at the Imperial potteries, while the private factories
were comparatively flourishing and even supplied some of the wares
required by the Court.</p>

<p>We learn from the Memoirs of Chiang that a variety of porcelains
were made to meet the tastes of the different regions of Southern
China. The market in Northern China does not seem as yet to
have been studied. Thus, while the kilns at Hu&ndash;t´ien,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> on the
river bank opposite to Ching&ndash;tê Chên, supplied a brownish yellow<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
ware which was popular in the province of Chêkiang, the greenish
white<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> porcelain of Ching&ndash;tê Chên found a profitable market in
Hunan and Hupeh, Szechuan, and Kuangtung. The inhabitants
of Kiangsu and Anhui seem to have been less critical, for the inferior
wares known as "yellow stuff" (<em>huang liao</em>), which did not sell in
Kiangsi, Kiangnan, Kuangtung, Fukien, and Chêkiang, was foisted
on them.</p>

<p>The finest porcelain was made of the stone (<em>shih</em>) from Chin&ndash;kêng,
while stone and earth from other neighbouring sites were
used for mixing in the inferior wares and for making seggars<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and
moulds. The glaze was made of "glaze earth" from Ling&ndash;pei
mixed with the ashes of brushwood from the Yu&ndash;shan hills which
had been burnt with lime and persimmon wood. I mention these
technical details because their similarity with the description of
the manufacture in the eighteenth century show that the method
of porcelain making at both periods was essentially the same. The
decoration was effected by stamping or pressing in moulds, by
painting or by carving<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>; and the ware was fired either upright
or inverted.</p>

<p>Some idea of the forms and ornament of these wares may be
gathered from another passage which would be far more illuminating
if the fanciful names used were less difficult to understand.
Bushell has boldly translated them according to his ideas, and I
quote his renderings in inverted commas and in the pious hope
that they may be correct, giving at the same time the original
characters.</p>

<p>There were bowls (<em>wan</em>), with high feet and with fish and water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ornament; platters (<em>t´ieh</em>) with "glazes shaded in different tones,"<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
sea eyes, and snow flowers<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>; dishes (<em>p´an</em>) of the horse hoof and
betel&ndash;nut kinds, the latter suggesting a brownish red colour; large
bowls (<em>yü</em>) with lotus ornament (or shaped like a lotus flower),
or of "square form with indented corners"<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>; bowls and platters
(<em>wan t´ieh</em>) with painted decoration,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> with silver designs,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> with
"fluted sides,"<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> and with "encircling strings."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Such wares as
these had a profitable market in Chêkiang, Kiangnan, Kiangsi
and Fukien.</p>

<p>There were besides incense burners of many forms, most of
which were modelled after bronzes, e.g. those shaped like the fabulous
beast <em>i</em>, "which eats tigers and can go five hundred <em>li</em> at a
bound"<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>; those like the bronze incense burners on three or four
feet (<em>ting</em>), like the cups used in the ancestral temple (<em>i</em>), like the
large iron cauldrons (<em>li</em>). Others had elephant legs, and others were
shaped like incense caskets or barrels. The vase forms include the
goblet (<em>ku</em>),<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> the gall&ndash;bladder (<em>tan</em>), the wine pot (<em>hu</em>) with spout
and handle, the Buddhist washing vessel (<em>ching</em>), the gardenia
(<em>chih tzŭ</em>), the lotus leaf (<em>ho yeh</em>), the gourd (<em>hu lu</em>), musical pipes
(<em>lü kuan</em>), vessels with ring&ndash;and&ndash;mask handles <em>shou huan</em>,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and
glass (<em>liu li</em>) forms.</p>

<p>The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>, which was written about sixty years later
than the publication of the Memoirs of Chiang, supplements this
information in a short paragraph on "Old Jao Chou wares." "Of
the Yüan wares," it says,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> "those with small foot and moulded
ornament (<em>yin hua</em>), and the specimens inscribed inside with the
characters <em>shu fu</em><a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> are highly valued. The recently made wares
with large foot and plain white (<em>su</em>) glaze are wanting in brilliancy
(<em>jun</em>). There are also green (<em>ch´ing</em>) wares and those with enamelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
(<em>wu sê</em>)<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> ornament, and they are very common. Of the modern
(i.e. beginning of the Ming dynasty) wares good specimens with
white colour and lustrous material are very highly valued. There
are besides dark green<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> wares with gilt ornament. They are
chiefly wine pots and wine cups, which are very lovely."</p>

<p>The <em>T´ao lu</em> has a paragraph on the <em>shu fu</em> wares which reflects
(not always very clearly) these earlier accounts, adding that "this
is the ware made in the private (<em>min</em>) factories and supplied to the
palace; the material had to be fine, white and unctuous clay,
and thin specimens were preferred.... Inside them were written
the characters <em>shu fu</em> as a mark. At the time the private factories
also issued imitations of these wares; but of the porcelains destined
for the Emperor ten out of a thousand, one out of a hundred, only
were selected. The private factories were unable to achieve uniform
success." The author has inserted the gilt and enamelled,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and
a large number of the other wares mentioned in the Memoirs of
Chiang and the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> in that irresponsible fashion which
makes much of the Chinese ceramic literature exceedingly difficult
to handle. Indeed, one is tempted to ask what was his authority
for the statement that the "private factories" made the <em>shu fu</em>
ware, in spite of the very circumstantial tone of the passage.</p>

<p>It is clear that the best of the Yüan wares made at Ching&ndash;tê
Chên was plain white or white with engraved and moulded
designs; and in this connection it is interesting to find an example
of <em>shu fu</em> porcelain described and illustrated in Hsiang's Album.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
It is a small, bottle&ndash;shaped vase with bulbous mouth, engraved
with a dragon and cloud design, and stated to be marked with
the characters <em>shu fu</em> under the base. We are told that in colour,
form, and design it was copied from a specimen of the Northern
Ting ware, and that the <em>shu fu</em> ware, itself copied from Ting
Chou originals, served as a model for the fine white engraved
porcelains of the Yung Lo and Hsüan Tê periods of the Ming
dynasty. It stood, in short, midway between the soft, opaque&ndash;looking,
creamy white Sung ware and the thin, hard, and highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
translucent Ming porcelain, such as the white Yung Lo bowl in
the Franks Collection (see Plate 59). Just such an intermediate
position as this is held by a bowl<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> in the British Museum with
white, translucent body, soft&ndash;looking glaze of faint creamy tinge
and engraved design of phœnixes and peony plants in Sung
style. It has, moreover, a raw mouth rim which shows that it
was fired inverted, and as there is no <em>shu fu</em> mark it may well
have been one of the copies of the Palace types which the <em>T´ao
lu</em> informs us were made at the private factories.</p>

<p>It is always difficult to determine the age of plain white wares,
but among the archaic specimens of translucent porcelain with
creamy white glaze and rough finish at the base which have come
from China in recent years under the varying descriptions of Sung,
Yüan and early Ming, there are, no doubt, several examples of
the Yüan wares of Ching&ndash;tê Chên (see Plate 46, Fig. 2).</p>

<p>The mention, in the Memoirs of Chiang and the <em>Ko ku yao lun</em>,
of painted decoration, enamelled ornament, silvering, and gilding,
though apparently but crudely used and little appreciated, is
nevertheless of great interest from the historical standpoint.</p>

<p>The potteries at Hu&ndash;t´ien which are mentioned in the Memoirs
of Chiang (see p. 160) were only separated from Ching&ndash;tê Chên
by the width of the river. They are described in the <em>T´ao lu</em><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
as active at the beginning of the Yüan dynasty and producing a
ware which, though of coarse grain, had "a considerable amount
of antique elegance," and appealed to the taste of the inhabitants
of the Chêkiang. The clay was hard and tough, and the colour of
the ware brownish yellow<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> as a rule, but even when of a "watery
white" tone it was tinged with the same brown colour. At the
end of the eighteenth century all trace of the factories had disappeared,
though the village still existed<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and the old wares were
still to be found.</p>

<p>Brinkley, who seems to have met with examples of the ware
in Japan, describes it as follows<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>: "The <em>pâte</em> is thick and dense,
without any of the delicacy of porcelain, and the glaze is muddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
yellow.... The surface of the pieces is generally relieved by
deeply incised designs of somewhat archaic character, figure subjects
being most common. Some examples are preserved in Japanese
collections, where they are known as <em>Ningyo&ndash;de</em> (figure subject
variety) in allusion to the nature of the incised designs." In spite
of its apparent roughness it was thought worthy of imitation at
Ching&ndash;tê Chên in the Ming dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Among the causes to which was attributed the lack of prosperity
at Ching&ndash;tê Chên in the Yüan period, the Memoirs of Chiang
includes (1) the uncertainty of the season on which the opening
of the factory partly depended, (2) the intolerable taxation and
the exactions of officials, and (3) the competition of the potteries
at Lin&ndash;ch´uan, Nan&ndash;fêng Hsien, and Chien&ndash;yang, all of which, as
Bushell indicates, lay on the trade route between Ching&ndash;tê Chên
and south&ndash;eastern coast towns.</p>

<p>Of these we learn in the <em>T´ao lu</em> that Lin&ndash;ch´uan<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> in the Fu&ndash;chou
Fu in Kiangsi (not far south of Ching&ndash;tê Chên) made a ware of
fine clay and thin substance, the colour of which was mostly white
with a slight yellowish tinge, and that some of the pieces were
coarsely ornamented, though we are not informed how the ornament
was applied. The same authority informs us that Nang&ndash;fêng
Hsien<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> in the Chien&ndash;yang Fu (also in Kiangsi) made a ware of
refined clay but somewhat thick substance, which was, as a rule,
decorated with blue designs (<em>ch´ing hua</em>), though some had the
colour of the <em>t´u ting</em> ware, i.e. the coarser and yellower variety
of Ting Chou porcelain.</p>

<p>From this passage it appears that "blue and white" may be
added to the types of ware made in the Yüan period.</p>

<p>The third factory, at Chien&ndash;yang in Fukien, has already been
discussed at some length. It was chiefly celebrated for the dark&ndash;coloured
wares (<em>wu&ndash;ni yao</em>) and the "hare's fur" and "partridge"
tea bowls.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>These names by no means exhaust the list of factories which
were active in the Yüan period. Others have been incidentally
mentioned elsewhere under the headings of Yüan&ndash;tz´ŭ, P´êng ware,
Hsin Ting ware, etc.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Ko ku yao lun</em> enumerates certain pottery forms which,
it asserts, were not in use before the Yüan period. As usual, the
Chinese descriptions are exceedingly difficult to visualise, and in
many cases are open to several interpretations, and are not easy
to reconcile with established facts. However, I quote the passage
as it stands: "Men of old when they drank tea used <em>p'ieh</em><a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> (? bowls
with curved sides), which were easy to drain and did not retain
the sediment. For drinking wine they used cups (<em>chan</em>); they
had not yet tried cups with handles (<em>pa chan</em><a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>), and in old times
they had no <em>ch'üan p'an</em>.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The Ting ware <em>ch'üan p'an</em> which one
sees nowadays are the brush washers (<em>hsi</em>) of olden times. The
men of old used 'decoction vases' for pouring wine, and did not
use ewers (<em>hu p'ing</em>) or bowls with contracted lip or tea cups
(<em>ch'a chung</em>) or dishes with rims.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> These were all forms used by
the Mongols. The men of China only began to use them in the
Yüan dynasty. They never appear in old Ting or Kuan wares."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p class="p6">KUANGTUNG <img src="images/i_166.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> WARES</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HOUGH the province of Kuangtung has long been celebrated
for its pottery, only very meagre information is procurable
on the history of its factories. A single reference in the
<em>T´u shu</em><a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> carries us back to the T´ang dynasty (618&ndash;906), when we
learn that earthenware cooking vessels were made in the potteries
(<em>t´ao chia</em>) of Kuang Chou (i.e. Canton), which when glazed were
better than iron vessels and more suitable for the decoction of
drugs. "A vessel of the capacity of a bushel sold for ten cash:
and they were things which were worth preserving."</p>

<p>The next mention occurs in the <em>T´ao lu</em>, which gives a short
account of the wares under the heading <em>Kuang yao</em>, but beyond
the statement that the industry originated at Yang&ndash;Chiang, it
gives no information as to the date or circumstances of its commencement.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
For the rest this account is very confused and unsatisfactory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and seems in part to refer to the porcelain decorated
at Canton (see vol. ii., p. 211), or more probably to the Canton
enamels. It is only in the last passage that we come into touch
with a ware which is readily recognised as the familiar Canton
stoneware. This is a hard&ndash;fired ware, usually dark brown at the
base, but varying at times to pale yellowish grey and buff, with a
thick smooth glaze distinguished from other ceramic glazes by its
characteristic mottling and dappling. The colour is often blue,
flecked and streaked with grey green or white over a substratum
of olive brown, or again green with grey and blue mottling. At
times the brown tints predominate, but the most prized varieties
are those in which the general tone is blue. These were specially
selected for imitation at the Imperial factories under T´ang
Ying, and they are highly valued in Japan, where the ware in
general goes by the name of <em>namako</em>.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> In other specimens the
glaze has a curdled appearance, and sometimes it seems to have
boiled up like lava. The mottled glazes at times have a superficial
resemblance to the dappled Chün wares, and there is no doubt that
in recent times these imitative effects have been studied.</p>

<p>The dating of the mottled Kuangtung wares, or Canton stonewares
as they are commonly named, is always a difficult matter.
They are still made and exported in large quantities, but it is certain
that they go back at least to late Ming times. Sir Arthur
Church exhibited a tray of this ware at the Burlington Fine Arts
Club in 1910<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> which bore a date corresponding to 1625, and the
name of the maker, Chin&ndash;shih. The glaze of this interesting piece
is remarkably deep, rich and lustrous, and it may be regarded as
typical of the finest period of the ware. The tray illustrated by
Fig. 1 of Plate 48 closely resembles it in colour and quality.
Stamped marks occasionally occur in these wares, the most frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>being the seals used by two potters, apparently brothers, named
Ko Ming&ndash;hsiang and Ko Yüan&ndash;hsiang (see p. 221). It was formerly
said that they lived at the end of the Ming period, but Dr. Bushell
in his <em>Chinese Art</em><a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> reduced their antiquity to the reign of Ch´ien
Lung (1736&ndash;1795). No reason is given for either of these dates,
but their work is familiar, and as some of the examples have a
decidedly modern aspect, I am strongly in favour of the later attribution.
Plate 47 is a fine example of a Kuangtung glaze, in which
the blue is conspicuous.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> It is probably of seventeenth&ndash;century
date.</p>

<p>Another Kuangtung group consists chiefly of figures and objects
modelled in the round and coated with rich crimson red <em>flambé</em>
or pea green celadon glazes, with a liberal display of dark brown
or red biscuit. Figures of the god of War and other deities
are often represented, the draperies heavily glazed and the
flesh parts in unglazed biscuit, which sometimes has the appearance
of being browned by a dressing of ferruginous clay. (See
Plate 48.)</p>

<p>Brinkley<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> describes several additional types of Kuang yao,
including a buff stoneware with "creamy crackled glaze of t´u
Ting type."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> "The characteristic type is a large vase or ewer<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
decorated with a scroll of lotus or peony in high relief and having
paint&ndash;like, creamy glaze of varying lustre and uneven thickness,
its buff colour often showing tinges of blue." Vases of similar
make seem also to aim at copying the red&ndash;splashed lavender glazes
of the Chün and Yüan wares, and sometimes the colour is very
beautiful, but the glaze has distinctive characteristics (see Plate 48,
Fig. 2). It is opaque, and lacks the translucent and flowing character
of the originals, and the surface has a peculiar sticky lustre,
and something of that silken sheen which distinguishes the Canton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and Yi&ndash;hsing glazes of this class. The crackle, too, is more open
and obvious. Some of these pieces have the appearance of considerable
antiquity, and are reputed to date back to Sung times.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
Midway between these and the familiar mottled Canton stoneware
come what are known in China as the Fat&ndash;shan Chün.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Their
obvious intention to imitate the old Chün wares is declared by the
appearance of numerals incised in Chün Chou fashion under the
base. A typical example (see Plate 51) is a high&ndash;shouldered flower
vase with short neck and small mouth (not a Sung but a Ming form,
be it noted), with thick, rolling, crackled glaze of pinkish cream
colour, shading into lavender and flushing deep red on the shoulders.
In rare instances the crimson spreads over the greater part of the
surface. The biscuit at the base is brownish grey if its light tint
is not concealed by a wash of dark clay. The glaze, unlike that
of the type described by Brinkley, is fairly fluescent, thin at the
mouth, and running thick in the lower levels. Other examples
of this class have heavily mottled grey or blue glazes nearer in
style to the Canton stoneware. Indeed, they are clearly made
at the same factory as the latter, for we have a connecting link
between the two groups in a vase in the Eumorfopoulos Collection,
a tall cylinder with streaky lavender blue glaze and the
usual silken lustre, the base of buff colour washed with brown
slip and marked with the square seal of Ko Ming&ndash;hsiang. Many
of these "Fat&ndash;shan Chün" wares are exceedingly attractive, but
by far the most beautiful are the rare dishes in which the glaze
has been allowed to form in deep pools of glass in the centre.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
In these pieces all the changing tints of the surrounding glaze
are concentrated in the cavity in a crystalline mass of vivid
colour. Such wares are, I think, not older than the Ch´ing
dynasty, though they have been erroneously described by some
writers as Sung.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the dates of the Fat&ndash;shan Chün types, the remarks
made on the Canton stoneware apply equally to them. Many are
frankly modern; the finer pieces may be assigned to the eighteenth
century, and a few perhaps go back to the Ming dynasty. From
the current name we infer that they are made at Fat&ndash;shan, but this
is the only evidence existing on the question. Fat&ndash;shan is situated
a few miles south&ndash;west of Canton with which it is connected by
railway. It is a large town, "renowned for its vast silk manufactures,
cloth&ndash;making, embroidery, cutlery, matting, paper, and
porcelain."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> No doubt the word porcelain in this context is a
comprehensive term, and includes stoneware and pottery, if, indeed,
it means anything else. But the precise provenance of the various
kinds of Kuang yao is far from clear. All that we learn from the
<em>T´ao lu</em> is that the Kuang yao originated at Yang&ndash;chiang. Probably
the type of mottled glaze which characterises the Canton stoneware
was first made there, and was afterwards adopted in the
factories which sprang up in the neighbourhood of Canton. Other
localities in the province of Kuangtung in which the ceramic industry
is represented include Chao&ndash;Ch´ing Fu,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> which may be only
a trading centre for the wares; Shih&ndash;wan, in Po&ndash;lo Hsien, a few
miles east of Canton, which is said<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> to supply the Canton markets
with "pots, dishes, and jars of every needed shape and size, some
of the latter as large as hogsheads, glazed and unglazed, together
with a large variety of imitation grotto work and figures for
gardens, gallipots, little images, etc."; and the prefecture of Lien&ndash;chou,
in the extreme south of the province, which exports its wares
from Pak&ndash;hoi. A few specimens bought in the neighbourhood of
the Shih&ndash;wan potteries, and no doubt of local make, are in the
British Museum. They consist of lion joss&ndash;stick holders, crab&ndash;shaped
pots for growing lily bulbs, and small figures of a hard,
rough stoneware of buff or drab colour. The bulb pots have an
opaque green glaze with passages of transparent <em>flambé</em> colours,
not unlike the Yi&ndash;hsing or Canton Chün glazes, and the other
pieces have washes of the thin, translucent green, turquoise, yellow,
and purplish brown glazes which are usually applied on the biscuit
of pottery or porcelain. The exhibits at the Paris Exhibition<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
in 1878 included "tea jars, tobacco pots, medicine jars, cassolettes,
various pots, plates, sauce vessels, rice bowls, wine and rice
cups, spoons, bird&ndash;cage pots, mortars, candlesticks, crucibles and
lamps" from the Pak&ndash;hoi district.</p>

<p class="p6">YI&ndash;HSING <img src="images/i_174.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> WARE</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE potteries at Yi&ndash;hsing Hsien, in the prefecture of Ch´ang&ndash;chou,
in Kiangsu, at no great distance from Shanghai, have
long been celebrated for elegantly shaped teapots of unglazed
stoneware in red and other colours. They have, in fact,
been honoured with a special book, the <em>Yang&ndash;hsien ming hu hsi</em>,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
or "Story of the teapots of Yang&ndash;hsien" (an old name for
Yi&ndash;hsing), written in the seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>; but though extracts
from this work occur in the <em>T´ao lu</em> and elsewhere, I have
been unable to get access to any copy of the original. This deficiency,
however, has been made good by an important translation
given by Brinkley<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> of a short Japanese work which, he says,
"owes nothing to Japanese research, being merely transcribed
from Chinese annals." The legendary story of the discovery of the
all&ndash;important clay deposits in Mount Tao&ndash;jung Shu&ndash;shan is followed
by a description of the chief varieties of this material which include
light yellow clay for mixing; another, yellow clay called <em>shih huang</em>
(stone yellow) which turned to cinnabar red in the firing; a blue
clay which turned to dark brown; a clay which produced a "pear
skin" colour; a light scarlet clay which produced a pottery of the
colour of pine spikelets; a light yellow clay making a green ware;
and another producing a light red pottery. The "pear skin" clay
mixed with white sand formed a material of a light ink brown colour.</p>

<p>With these materials, and with their conspicuous skill in blending
clays, it may well be imagined that the Yi&ndash;hsing potters were
able to make innumerable varieties in their ware. The commonest
shades, however, are deep and light red, chocolate brown, buff,
drab and black brown; occasionally the clays are speckled&mdash;e.g.
buff ware with blue specks&mdash;or powdered with minute particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of quartz, and frequently two or more clays are used in contrasting
tints on the same piece. The body of the ware is sometimes
soft enough to powder under the knife, but as a rule it is a very
hard stoneware, capable of receiving a fine polish on the lapidary's
wheel. The choicest teapots are unglazed, though often a sort
of natural gloss has formed on the surface in the kiln.</p>

<p>But to continue the history of the factories as outlined in
Brinkley's translation, we are told that the first maker of "choice
utensils of pottery for tea&ndash;drinking purposes" was a priest of the
Chin&ndash;sha temple about thirteen miles south&ndash;east of Yi&ndash;hsing, and
that the first really great Yi&ndash;hsing potter was Kung Ch´un <img src="images/i_175a.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />
who flourished in the Chêng Tê period (1506&ndash;1521). Though it
would appear that Kung Ch´un, while attending his master Wu
I&ndash;shan at the Chin&ndash;sha temple, surreptitiously learnt the secrets of
the priest, his fame completely eclipsed that of his teacher, and he
is usually venerated as the founder of the Yi&ndash;hsing potteries. His
pots are described as being "hand made, and in most of them
thumb&ndash;marks are faintly visible. Generally their colour is that
of a chestnut, and they have a subdued lustre like oxidised gold.
Their simplicity and accuracy of shape are inimitable; worthy to
be ascribed to divine revelations."</p>

<p>Supernatural qualities form the only point in common between
this description and that of the two teapots figured in Hsiang's
Album,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and confidently assigned to Kung Ch´un. One of these
is a drab ware and of hexagonal shape, which appears to have
been formed in a mould; the other is in the form of a wine ewer
and of vermilion red; and both are stated to have the wonderful
quality of changing colour when filled with tea. In fact, in the
second illustration the artist has depicted this phenomenon, the
pot being vermilion red above and green below the tea&ndash;line. The
price of these two pots in the sixteenth century was no less than
500 taels or ounces of silver.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Brinkley's translation gives a considerable
list of Yi&ndash;hsing potters who made a reputation in the
Ming dynasty, but as the characters are not added it does not always
help us to identify the names,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> among the potter's marks, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>most cases the characteristics assigned to them are entirely vague.
We learn, for instance, that one man's "forte was beauty of decoration,"
and that three others were "renowned for the excellence
of their pottery." On the other hand, it is important to read
that Tung Han in the Wan Li period (1573&ndash;1619) was "the first
potter who ornamented the surface of the Yi&ndash;hsing ware with elaborate
designs in relief," and that many of the pieces designed by
Ch´ên Chung&ndash;mei,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> who had formerly been a porcelain maker, "such
as perfume boxes, flower vases, paper weights, and so forth, show
singularly fine moulding and chiselling. His vases were shaped
in the form of flowers, leaves, and fruits, and were decorated with
insects. His dragons sporting among storm&ndash;clouds, with outstretched
claws and straining eyes; his statuettes of the goddess
Kuanyin, her features at once majestic and benevolent&mdash;these
are indeed wonderful productions, instinct with life." This passage
shows, at any rate, that in the Ming period the Yi&ndash;hsing potters
did not confine their attention to tea wares. Perhaps the most
celebrated Yi&ndash;hsing potter was Shih Ta&ndash;pin, who followed in
the footsteps of the great Kung Ch´un, and eventually surpassed
him.</p>

<p>Brinkley's translation gives us very precise views of what the
true form of the teapot should be. It should be small, so that
the bouquet of the tea be not dispersed, and every guest should
have a pot to himself. It should be shallow, with a cover which
is convex inside; and it is very important that the spout should
be straight. Crooked spouts were very liable to become obstructed
by the tea leaves. "One drinks tea for pleasure, and one may
justly feel irritated if the beverage declines to come out of the
pot." The true form of teapot, we are told, began with Kung
Ch´un, from which one infers that the tea bowls of the T´ang and
Sung usage were in vogue up to his time. But the correct shape
once established, the Yi&ndash;hsing potters soon began to take liberties
with it, and to twist it into all manner of fanciful forms, such as
fruits (persimmon, pomegranate, finger citron), the leaf or the seed&ndash;pod
of the lotus, creature forms such as fish leaping from waves,
a phœnix, and innumerable other quaint shapes, always skilfully
modelled and often of high artistic merit.</p>

<p>The ware, as already stated, is chiefly red, dark and light,
chocolate brown, buff, and drab, and it is usually without glaze.
The decoration consists of: (1) Engraved designs, cut in the ware
while it was still soft. These are usually inscriptions of a poetic
nature, great importance being attached to the calligraphy. Indeed,
we are told that "some of the potters of Yi&ndash;hsing owed their
reputation chiefly to their skill in carving inscriptions. Such a
man was Chan&ndash;chien, whose style of writing has been much imitated
by modern artists. Another was Ta&ndash;hsin, who was employed by
Shih Ta&ndash;pin to write inscriptions, and who was such a master of
penmanship that his inscriptions have been carefully transcribed
and are used by connoisseurs as a standard of excellence." (2)
Low reliefs, either formed in the teapot mould or separately stamped
out and stuck on. Occasionally gilding is found on these, but it
is probably a European addition. (3) Stamped diapers of key
fret, and other familiar patterns, usually forming the background
for relief ornament or borders. (4) Openwork designs applied in
panels over an inner lining which was usually washed with a light&ndash;tinted
clay. The pierced work is commonly of floral design, often
the prunus, bamboo and pine pattern, and on dishes and saucers
it has no backing but is left <em>à jour</em>. All these methods of ornament
are found on the examples which reached Europe at the end
of the seventeenth century, and they supplied designs for the
European potters of that period. (5) A later type of ornament
consists of opaque coloured enamels in painted designs or as
ground&ndash;colours completely hiding the surface of the ware. The
colours are always of the <em>famille rose</em> variety, including opaque
pink,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> and I do not know of any example which suggests an
earlier date than Ch´ien Lung (1736&ndash;1795). Most, indeed, appear
to be nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In addition to these, certain less familiar styles of ornament
are found on the smaller objects, such as the heads of opium pipes,
which are beautifully made and tastefully decorated. The red
ware is sometimes coated with a transparent glaze of yellowish
tint, giving a surface of warm reddish brown, exactly similar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>the eighteenth century Astbury ware of Staffordshire; or, again,
it is polished on the lapidary's wheel like the Böttger ware of Dresden.
Inlaid designs in fine white clay and marbling are further varieties;
and occasionally coloured glazes of great beauty occur. But these
will be discussed presently.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the variety of articles made by the Yi&ndash;hsing
potters, but they chiefly excelled in small and dainty articles for
the writing&ndash;table, the toilet, and the tea&ndash;table, and personal ornaments.
Their tea wares have always been highly prized in Japan,
where they have been cleverly copied in Banko ware and by the
Kioto potters. Similarly, when tea&ndash;drinking became an institution
in Europe in the last half of the seventeenth century, and the
East India companies set themselves to supply the necessary
apparatus from China, the Yi&ndash;hsing red teapots became fashionable,
and were immediately imitated by enterprising potters. The
Dutch and English seem to have been the first to succeed in this
new departure, and we read that Ary de Milde and W. van Eenhorn,
of Delft, applied for a monopoly of the manufacture in Holland
in 1679, while John Dwight, of Fulham, included the "Opacous,
redd and Dark coloured Porcellane or China" in the patent taken
out in London five years later. The brothers Elers, of Dutch
extraction, started the industry in Staffordshire about 1693, and
made red stoneware teapots scarcely distinguishable from the
Chinese, and which sold for a guinea a piece.</p>

<p>The Yi&ndash;hsing wares in the celebrated Chinese ceramic collection
formed by Augustus the Strong at Dresden supplied designs for the
fine red stoneware made in the first years of the eighteenth century
by Böttger, who also discovered the secret of true porcelain in
Europe and founded the famous Meissen porcelain factory.</p>

<p>From the earliest days of their importation the Yi&ndash;hsing wares
have been known in Europe, especially in Italy, Spain, and Portugal,
by the Portuguese name of <em>buccaro</em>. The true <em>buccaro</em> is a scented
pottery, first imported from Central and South America, where it
was made by the Indian population and afterwards manufactured
in Portugal and Spain; and Count Lorenzo Magalotti, who wrote
in 1695, protested against the application of the name "to certain
unglazed pieces of Oriental origin," asserting that "true Buccaro
never came from China or Japan, and that they must not
be looked for out of the pottery sent over from Central America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
or the Portuguese imitations."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> But the protests of purists were
unavailing, and <em>buccaro</em> seems to have become a regular term
for unglazed pottery, even the archaic black ware from the Etruscan
tombs receiving the name of <em>buchero nero</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Another important group of Yi&ndash;hsing wares presents an entirely
different aspect, and indeed it is little understood in Europe, though
it is probably bought by unwary collectors for the Sung types
which it purports to imitate. This is the Yi&ndash;hsing Chün, to which
allusion has already been made in discussing the imitation Chün
wares. The traditions of this manufacture go back to the Ming
dynasty, when a potter named Ou <img src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> gained a great reputation
for his glazes, which "copied the Ko ware in crackle and the
Kuan and Chün wares in colour."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> This is, no doubt, the manufacture
mentioned in the <em>Po wu yao lan</em> in the passage dealing
with Chün yao: "At the present time (i.e. 1621&ndash;1627), among
the recent manufactures this kind of ware is all made with the
sandy clay (<em>sha t´u</em>) of Yi&ndash;hsing as body; the glaze is rather
like the original, and in some cases beautiful, but it does not
wear well."</p>

<p>Though the original glazed wares of Ou are probably rarer
to&ndash;day than their Chün Chou prototypes, there is no reason to
suppose that Ou´s successors have not kept up the continuity of
the manufacture. It is certainly very much alive to&ndash;day, and
an early eighteenth century reference to "the applied glaze of
Yi&ndash;hsing"<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> seems to imply its existence at that time. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>before me as I write a tripod incense burner of archaic form, the
body a light buff stoneware and the glaze a deep lavender, breaking
into blue. It is a thick and rather opaque glaze, sufficiently flowing
to have left the upper edges almost bare and formed thickly on
the flatter and lower levels; the colour is broken by streaks and
clouding, which mark the downward flow of the glaze; the surface
has a barely perceptible crackle, which will no doubt become more
marked with age, and a subdued lustre between the brilliancy of
the old opalescent Chün types and the viscous, silken sheen of the
Canton glazes<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> which also imitate them. The colour and glaze
are distinctly attractive, and have much in common with the old
Chün glazes, and though this is a frankly modern piece, it shows
the potentialities of the ware. Similar specimens made, say, a
hundred or two hundred years ago, and proportionately aged by
time and usage, might well cause trouble to the collector.</p>

<p>There are, besides, quantities of common glazed pottery made
at Yi&ndash;hsing in the present day, and probably for a considerable
time back, which has no mission to imitate the antique. Many
of the modern ginger pots are said to come from this locality, and
their glazes&mdash;some with clear colours (yellow, green, or purple),
others opaque and clouded, often covering moulded ornament in
low relief&mdash;may help us to identify kindred types of glaze on pieces
which are more ornamental and perhaps much older. But pottery,
as distinct from porcelain and the finer stonewares, has never commanded
much interest in China, and it has never been systematically
collected and studied. The result is that it is extremely difficult
to place the various types which appear from time to time
except in large and ill&ndash;defined groups. A series of typical pieces
of modern Yi&ndash;hsing pottery, for instance, would no doubt be of
the greatest value in identifying the rather older wares made in
the same place under similar traditions, but no one in Europe<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
has thought it worth their while to form one.</p>

<p>I have noticed that a certain type of glazed pottery is distinguished
by a concave base which serves instead of the usual hollowed&ndash;out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
foot and foot rim, and by a glaze which stops a little short of
the base in an even, regular line which is quite distinct from the
wavy glaze line of the Yuan and earlier wares. A jar of this type
in the British Museum has a typical Yi&ndash;hsing glaze, and though
this is not perhaps sufficient ground for generalising, I would
suggest that this peculiar finish is an indication of Yi&ndash;hsing
manufacture.</p>

<p class="p6">MISCELLANEOUS POTTERIES</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N addition to the factories which have received individual
notice, there are numerous others which are only names to
us; and, on the other hand, there is a host of nameless wares
which have reached Europe at various times and through divers
channels, and are now awaiting classification with very little chance
of being definitely located. A consideration, however, suggested by
the <em>Chinese Commercial Guide</em><a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> may help towards the grouping of
these miscellaneous wares. We are told that the charges for
freight forbid the wares to be carried far in the ordinary way of
internal trade, and that manufactures of pottery are numerous,
supplying the local needs. Now the number of ports open to
foreign trade in China is limited, and in the past the sea trade
was of far smaller volume, and was concentrated in a few of the
southern coast towns. Consequently, in dealing with pottery which
we may assume to have been brought by the export trade to
Europe, it will be necessary for general purposes to take account
only of the factories in the neighbourhood of the seaports in question.
These will be found to be almost entirely in the southern
half of China.</p>

<p>Thus, starting from the south and following the coast line, we
come first to the potteries which supplied Pak&ndash;hoi and Canton,
and we may assume that Hongkong and Kowloon would be supplied
from the neighbourhood of Canton. These have already been discussed,
and we can pass on to Swatow, which would draw supplies
from the Ch´ao&ndash;chou Fu potteries. This neighbourhood furnished
an exhibit to the Paris Exhibition of 1878, consisting of "tea jars,
tobacco jars, braziers and pots, lamps, tiles, flower pots, fruit jars,
spoons, vases of various sorts, figures, dishes, cups and saucers,
and spittoons."</p>

<p>At the same exhibition, Amoy, to which we come next, was
represented by "dishes, rice bowls, wine cups, saucers and spoons,
preserve jars, wine bottles, etc., in common porcelain," besides
tiles of various kinds, which implies the manufacture of pottery
as well. These wares, we are informed in the catalogue, are largely
exported to Saigon, Siam, Manilla, etc.; a statement confirmed
by the <em>Chinese Commercial Guide</em>,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> which adds India, the Archipelago,
and the southern provinces. This is interesting in view
of the quantities of coarse china, blue and white<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and coloured,
which is brought from these parts by collectors who take its crude
appearance as evidence of age. The factories are located at Pa&ndash;kwoh,
a village near Shih&ndash;ma, which lies between Amoy and Chang&ndash;chou
Fu. Tung&ndash;an Hsien in the same neighbourhood is also named as
a pottery centre.</p>

<p>There are several important factories within easy reach of
Shanghai. Those at Yi&ndash;hsing have been discussed at some length,
but there is another large centre of the industry on the east side
of the Lake T´ai&ndash;hu opposite to Yi&ndash;hsing. This is Su Chou <img src="images/i_187a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />,
which, according to the catalogue of the Paris Exhibition, was still
celebrated for its pottery in 1878. But the reputation of Su Chou
does not rest on its modern achievements. Its name occurs frequently
in the pottery section of the great encyclopædia (compiled
by order of the Emperor K´ang Hsi) as one of the prominent
pottery centres in the Ming dynasty. Tiles for the palaces and
temples of Nanking were made there, and vases and wine vessels
for the Imperial Court. The nature of these last can be guessed
from a hint given in one passage of the encyclopædia<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>: "At Su
Chou iron rust (<em>hsiu</em>) and other materials are used for the yellow
wares. For the vessels with dragon and phœnix destined for
Imperial use, a resinous substance<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and cobalt blue<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> are used."</p>

<p>In the Hsüan Tê period (1426&ndash;1435), Su Chou was noted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>the manufacture of artistic pots for holding fighting crickets. In
reference to these we are informed in the <em>T´ao shuo</em> (see Bushell,
op. cit., p. 140) that "those fabricated at Su Chou by the two
makers named Lu <img src="images/i_188a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> and Tsou <img src="images/i_188b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> were beautifully moulded, and
artistically carved and engraved, and the pots made by the Elder
and the Younger Hsiu <img src="images/i_188c.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, two daughters of Tsou, were the finest
of all. At this time fighting crickets was a favourite pastime,
and hundreds and thousands of cash were staked upon the event,
so that they did not grudge spending large sums upon the pots,
which were decorated in this elaborate way, and consequently far
surpassed the ordinary porcelain of the period."</p>

<p>The large and important potteries at Po&ndash;shan Hsien <img src="images/i_188d.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />
in the Ch´ing&ndash;chou Fu, in Shantung, were represented only by a
small exhibit at the Paris Exhibition of 1878, consisting of "a
bottle of glazed pottery, three tea jars in red ware, ten specimens
of glazed pottery, a brazier in terra cotta, and seven crucibles."
Laufer tells us that these potteries date back to Sung times, and
have preserved the old traditions of manufacture. The district
is also noted for its glass, enamels and glazing materials, but it
is situated inland, and not conveniently near any of the treaty
ports.</p>

<p>In the early days of the European trading companies, pottery,
as distinct from porcelain, does not seem to have received much
attention from the merchants, and we may fairly assume that
most of the earthenwares which reached Europe before the last
century hailed from the neighbourhood of Canton or from Yi&ndash;hsing
and the Shanghai district. But long before the first European
vessels reached the coasts of China, Arab and Chinese merchantmen
had carried cargoes of pottery and coarse porcelain to the Philippines,
the East Indian Archipelago, the Malay Peninsula, Siam,
Ceylon, and India. The Arabs had a trading station in Canton
in the eighth century, and Chinese junks sailed from Canton and
the Fukien ports in the Sung, Yüan, and Ming dynasties. A Chinese
account of the sea trade in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
may be read in the work of Chao Ju&ndash;kua,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and it will be found from
this book and from Marco Polo's accounts that Ch´üan&ndash;chou Fu
on the Fukien coast was a busy centre of foreign trade in the Sung
and Yüan periods. Hirth<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> has traced the probable route by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>the Lung&ndash;ch´üan celadons reached this port for shipment, and
doubtless the other wares, including coarse white porcelain, stonewares
and pottery, which are found in the Philippines and Borneo
(to name only two of many localities) were largely supplied from
the Fukien potteries. Many of these wares are of undoubted
antiquity, and some of the types are unknown in China to&ndash;day.
They may have been made solely for export, but in any case their
disappearance in China is quite intelligible. For even in the eighth
century the merchants were forbidden<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> to export "precious and
rare articles," and most of these trade goods are of coarse make
and unlikely to be preserved by the Chinese at home.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the natives of the Philippines and the Dyaks
of Borneo have preserved these old potteries with scrupulous care.
The various types of jars have been christened with special names<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
alluding to their form or decoration; they have been credited
with supernatural powers; and numerous legends have grown
endowing them with life and movement, power of speech, and influences
malevolent or benign.</p>

<p>A good collection of these pots would be of considerable interest,
but the value attached to them by their native owners is out of
all proportion to their intrinsic worth, and makes them difficult
to procure. An important series, however, of the Philippine jars
has been formed by the Field Museum at Chicago, and they are
described with full illustration in one of the excellent publications
of that institution.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Among other things we are told that "every
wild tribe encountered by the writer in the interior of Luzon, Palawan,
and Mindanao possesses these jars, which enter intimately into
the life of the people. Among many the price paid by the bridegroom
for his bride is wholly or in part in jars. When a Tinguian
youth is to take his bride, he goes to her house at night, carrying
with him a Chinese jar which he presents to his father&ndash;in&ndash;law.
The liquor served at ceremonies and festivals is sometimes contained
in these jars, while small porcelain dishes contain the food
offered to the spirits."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>A general similarity in form is noticeable in the Philippine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
jars, an ovoid body more or less elongated being common to all,
while the neck varies a little in its height and width. A series of
loop handles or pierced masks on the shoulder, to hold a cord for
suspension, is a constant feature. The older types, which are
said to date back to a period ranging from the thirteenth to the
fifteenth century, are frequently decorated with one or two large
dragons coiling round the sides, and either modelled in low relief
or incised in the body. Others are quite plain, and the glazes
include black, brown, dark green, and a brownish yellow of varying
depth. A later group, not older than the end of the Ming
dynasty, is without ornament, but coated with single&ndash;colour or
variegated glazes of the Canton and Yi&ndash;hsing types&mdash;e.g. speckled
blue with green flecks, green with blue streaks and lines, blue and
green mottled and crackled, light bluish green&mdash;the glaze often
ending short of the base in an even line, which is, perhaps,
characteristic of Yi&ndash;hsing.</p>

<p>The British Museum has a small series from Borneo, which
includes, among the older types of pottery, a jar with black&ndash;brown
glaze and bands of cloud design and stiff leaves deeply incised,
and an ovoid jar with many loop handles on the shoulders, two
dragons in relief, and a ground of incised wave pattern all covered
with a yellowish brown glaze which ends in a regularly waved line
some way short of the&ndash;base. Of later make is a jar with translucent
purplish brown glaze, and four circular panels with figure ornament
in low relief glazed green, a type described by the Japanese
as "Old Kochi."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> There are, besides, a jar with roughly painted
blue dragon designs under a crackled white glaze, the ware being
a coarse porcellanous stoneware; another with enamel colours in
addition to the underglaze blue including the rose pink which
is not older than the eighteenth century; and another type with
rough stoneware or earthen body covered with a crackled, greyish
white enamel of putty&ndash;like surface on which enamel colours are
coarsely painted. The typical jar which the island natives so highly
prize is of the ovoid form with a number of loop handles on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
shoulder and dragons in relief.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> An unusually ornate example is
shown on Plate 49. It has a cloudy green crackled glaze with
dragons of both the ordinary and the archaic kind, besides storks
and a bat in low relief, and there are touches of dark blue and
yellow, white and brown in the glaze. It is probably of Canton
make and not older than the seventeenth century. In modern
times jars are made in Borneo itself by the Chinese in the coast
towns.</p>

<p>A certain amount of Chinese pottery found its way, like the
celadon porcelains in early times, by the caravan routes into
Turkestan, India, Persia, and Western Asia. Such wares would
be more naturally drawn from the potteries in Honan, Chihli, and
the north&ndash;western provinces, and it is not surprising that the fragment
found by Sir Aurel Stein in the buried cities of Turkestan
should have included the brown painted wares of Tz´ŭ Chou.</p>

<p>But the greatest difficulties in classification are presented by
the miscellaneous pottery which collectors have picked up from
time to time in China, or antique dealers have sent over to supply
the demand created by the increasing interest taken in Chinese
pottery by Western amateurs. These come, as a rule, without any
hint as to their place of origin, and in most cases it is quite impossible
to locate them. There are, however, certain well&ndash;defined
groups which come together naturally.</p>

<p>One of these is represented by the Tradescant jar in the Ashmolean
Museum, Oxford. It was exhibited at the Burlington Fine
Arts Club in 1910, and described in the catalogue<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> as "Jar with
globular body, short neck, and wide mouth; five loop handles;
stoneware covered with a bright green glaze; the ornament consists
of floral scrolls in yellow with touches of brown and is in low
relief; round the base a formal design. Height, 12 inches." A
similar jar is shown on Plate 56, and in the Goff collection in the
Brighton Museum is another of the same make, but with the design
incised with a point instead of applied in relief. The Tradescant
Collection was given to Elias Ashmole in 1659 by John Tradescant.
It was formed by the father of the donor, who died in 1627, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
at the lowest computation the antiquity of these wares is fixed in
the late Ming period. Another group is represented by Plate 58,
Fig. 2. Its characteristics are a comparatively thin buff earthenware
body, soft enough to powder under the knife, and a sparing use of
brownish yellow, bright turquoise, green<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> and aubergine glazes of the
usual crackled type applied direct to the body. The specimens
are generally vases or incense burners of curious and archaic forms,
with ornament moulded in low relief, the whole bearing the unmistakable
signs of a ware which has been pressed in a mould. The
inside and bottom of the incense burners are usually unglazed. The
colours, as a rule, are pleasing and soft, and it is the common
practice to label them indiscriminately Ming. As nothing definite
is known of their place of origin, this chronology can only be based
on their archaistic appearance, or on the fact that they have the
usual "on biscuit" glazes, which seems to be the accepted signal
for a Ming attribution. Needless to say, the use of this method
of colouring survived the demise of the last Ming emperor, and
it is improbable that wares which must be comparatively common
in China (judging from the handsome way in which the quite recently
created demand for them has been answered) should have a minimum
antiquity of two hundred and seventy years.</p>

<p>The fact is that dating of these glazed potteries is as difficult
as that of the cognate glazed tiles, and it is as unreasonable to
exclude a Ch´ing origin as it would be to exclude a Ming. The
balance of probabilities, at any rate, is in favour of the bulk of them
being no older than the eighteenth century.</p>

<h5> PLATE 54</h5>

<blockquote><p>Vase with lotus handles: buff stoneware with lotus design

<p class="center">Height 18 inches. <span class="mleft8">&nbsp;</span><em>Grandidier Collection, Louvre.</em><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="pl_054" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img src="images/pl_054.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A third group is also consistently labelled Ming, but with better
reason, though even here a little more elasticity in the dating is
advisable. It has an exact parallel in porcelains of undoubted Ming
origin, viz. those represented by Plate 61, etc., which usually take
the form of jars and vases with designs outlined in fillets of clay, or
channelled or even pierced <em>à jour</em>. The spaces between the outlines
are filled with coloured glazes which are fired, in the case of
porcelain, in the cooler parts of the biscuit kiln. These are the
glazes <em>de demi&ndash;grand feu</em>, according to the French definition, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><br /><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>consist of turquoise and aubergine purple or violet and green (the
three colours or <em>san ts´ai</em>, all minutely crackled), supplemented by
a white formed by slip and a thin brownish yellow. Occasionally
the purple is so deep as to appear almost black; and the details
of the designs are often etched in the paste with a fine point. Precisely
similar wares are found with an earthenware body; and
they are, no doubt, contemporary with the analogous porcelains,
though how long the traditions of this type of ware continued has
never been precisely determined. The porcelain on which washes
of turquoise and aubergine glaze are combined is a development
of this type, and this has certainly survived to comparatively
modern times. Reticulated ornament was used on the three&ndash;colour
pottery vases no less than on the porcelain (Plate 55); and besides
the covered wine jars and vases there are figures and grotto pieces
of similar style both in pottery and porcelain, many of which must
date from Ming times.</p>

<p>Plate 53 illustrates a beautiful vase in the Eumorfopoulos Collection
which belongs to a cognate group. It has a buff stoneware
body, the ornament is outlined in relief, and the glazes which fill
the outlines are very similar to those of our main group, though
some of the colours are more transparent and glassy and wanting
in the solidity of the latter. The chrysanthemum handles are a
frequent feature of the vases of this class, of which a notable instance
is in the Salting Collection. Plate 54 illustrates another vase
of similar kind, but with lotus handles, lotus designs, and a fine
turquoise ground. Of the same type, but less rare, are certain
wide&ndash;mouthed jars, bowls, and flower pots with bold floral designs,
lotuses, etc., outlined in fillets of clay and filled with the same
kinds of glaze, the background now turquoise and now aubergine
(Plate 58, Fig. 1). The base is usually washed over with a thin
purplish brown. These several types were copied in the Japanese
Kishiu pottery in the nineteenth century, and though the copies
are rarely difficult to distinguish by the eye alone the Japanese
glazes (particularly the aubergine) will be found on handling to
have a peculiar moist and rather sticky surface. Though no
doubt of Ming origin, it is extremely probable that the manufacture
of the Chinese bowls and flower pots of this class continued
into the last dynasty.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 of Plate 56 exemplifies another kind of pottery with fine
white body like pipeclay, and usually with sharply moulded designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in antique bronze style and in the bronze forms of beakers and
four&ndash;legged incense burners. The glaze is usually leaf green, but it
often breaks out into a frothy grey scum, such as is seen on some
of the Canton and Yi&ndash;hsing glazed pottery. It is a common practice
to label these wares as T´ang, but I am inclined to place them in
a much more recent period (seventeenth or eighteenth century),
and to locate them among the miscellaneous Kuangtung wares,
pending further information on the subject.</p>

<p>There are other specimens with a somewhat similar white and
relatively soft body material, not glazed but stained with a brownish
black dressing of clay, and somewhat recalling bronze. These
are usually vases of elegant, well&ndash;moulded form, such as Plate 56,
Fig. 3, and they are often marked <em>Nan hsiang t´ang</em>.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> They are,
no doubt, of relatively modern make.</p>

<p>Though it would be easy to suggest many possible places of
origin for these wares, such speculation can be of no real value
without far more definite evidence than we possess at present.
Still, it may serve some useful purpose in the future, if not at once,
if we add one or two more records, however meagre, to the existing
lists of Chinese potteries. The section of the <em>T´u shu</em>, which
is devoted to <em>T´ao kung</em> (the pottery industry), mentions the following
factories as of some importance in the Ming dynasty. In the
province of Honan, in addition to the well&ndash;known potteries of
Chün Chou and Ju Chou, we read that there was a factory in
the Ju&ndash;ning Fu at the village of Ts´ai <img src="images/i_198a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, which was intermittently
active in the first half of the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>From another passage we learn that in the valleys of Ching<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
<img src="images/i_198b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> and the hills of Shu (or Szech´uan) there are black and yellow
clays suitable for pottery; that the potters had their kilns in holes
in the mountains; and that they used the yellow clay for the body
of the ware and overlaid it with the black, making jars, drug pots,
cauldrons, pots, dishes, bowls, sacrificial vessels, and the like. They
also made one kind of ware which resembled that of Chün Chou.</p>

<p>Specimens of modern pottery in the Field Museum, Chicago,
include ornamental wares such as pomegranate&ndash;shaped water pots,
etc., covered with an oily green glaze recalling some of the Sung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
types. The body is apparently dark coloured, and shows brown
at the edges where the glaze is thin. This ware is made at Ch´êng&ndash;tu
in Szech´uan.</p>

<p>The geographical annals of the province of Shensi are quoted<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
with reference to potteries in the T´ung&ndash;chou Fu as follows: "The
inhabitants of Lei&ndash;hsiang and Pai&ndash;shui<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> are good potters, and the
porcelains (<em>tz´ŭ ch´i</em>) which they make are of surpassingly clever
workmanship. These are what are commonly called <em>lei kung ch´i</em>
(vessels of the Lord of Thunder). Some say that the potteries of
Hsiang only began to be active when the original wares had ceased
to be made. The village of Lei&ndash;hsiang is east of Shên Hsien, and
it is the place of the temple of the Hsiang family. The inhabitants
of the place sometimes dig up castaway Hsiang wares. Their
shape and style are archaic; the colour of the ware is green (<em>lü</em>),
deep and dark, but brilliant. One kind has slight ornament in
raised clay, but if the hand is passed over it, the surface feels smooth
and without perceptible relief or indentation.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> When compared with
the Hsüan,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Ko and other wares, it may be said to surpass them."
The description in the last part seems to apply to the older wares
which preceded those made in the district at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The modern potteries at Yo Chou in Shensi are represented in
the Field Museum, Chicago, by a black&ndash;painted ware in Tz´ŭ Chou
style, by a greyish white ware with sketchy blue designs, and by
a black slag&ndash;like earthenware which is extremely light to handle.
It is also suggested that a well known type of pottery, painted
with free floral designs in black and white on a creamy glaze which
is stained a pinkish brown colour, is an earlier product of the same
potteries.</p>

<p>The potteries at Ch´ü&ndash;yang Hsien <img src="images/i_199a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in the Chên&ndash;ting Fu,
in Chihli, are mentioned<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> in the administrative records of the
Ming dynasty in the Hsüan Tê period, and again under the dates
1553 and 1563, as supplying wine jars and vases for the Court.
This place is only a few miles east of Ting Chou, which was celebrated
for its white wares in the Sung period, and these references
carry the record of the industry in that district to the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
part of the Ming dynasty. Unfortunately, nothing is said of the
nature of the wares made at this time for the Court.</p>

<p>Reference is made elsewhere (p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>) to the potteries at
Wu&ndash;ch´ing Hsien, in the Peking district. Possibly these are the
potteries described, by Bushell<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> as still active in modern times.
"The ordinary glaze," he remarks, "is a reddish brown of marked
iridescence, shining with an infinity of metallic specks, an effective
background to the moulded decoration which covers the surface.
The designs are generally of hieratic character."</p>

<p>The "sun&ndash;stone" glazes made at the Rookwood Potteries (Cincinnati,
Ohio, U.S.A.) and on the Lancastrian wares<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> are of this
kind, the infinity of metallic specks being due to "super&ndash;saturation"
of the glaze with iron oxide. A specimen of this modern
Peking ware may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The tile works at Liu&ndash;li&ndash;chü, near Peking, date back to the
Yüan dynasty, and their modern productions as represented in
the Field Museum include a pottery with incised designs filled in
with yellow, green, and dark aubergine glazes, not unlike in style
to the Japanese Sanuki ware. Another type has forms taken from
bronzes and is distinguished by a shining green glaze.</p>

<p>In the province of Shantung, besides the tile works at Lin&ndash;ch´ing,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
the important, potteries at Yen&ndash;shên Chên <img src="images/i_200a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in the
Ch´ing&ndash;chou Fu are noticed<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> as follows: "The inhabitants have
inherited from their ancestors the art of making good pottery.
The usual wares are cisterns (<em>kang</em>), jars (<em>ying</em>), cauldrons (<em>fu</em>), and
such&ndash;like pottery (<em>fou</em>), made without flaw. The profit to the
people is not less than that made at Ching&ndash;tê Chên on the right
bank of the Yangtze." Yen&ndash;shên Chên is quite close to Po&ndash;shan
Hsien, and no doubt the industry at the two places is intimately
connected. The latter, which is noted to this day for its manufactures
of pottery and glass, has already been mentioned<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> more
than once.</p>

<p>At Yi&ndash;chên <img src="images/i_200b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in the Yang&ndash;chou Fu, in Kiangsu, there were
factories which supplied wine jars, etc., to the palace at Nanking
in the early years of the Ming dynasty; and in the seventh year
of Chia Ching (1528) supplies of similar vessels were sent from
Ning&ndash;kuo Fu <img src="images/i_201a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in the south&ndash;west of Anhui.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The latter

Chou <img src="images/i_201b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> as producing a thin white ware made of "plastic clay"
in the Yüan and Ming periods. A verse of Wang Shih&ndash;chêng (1526&ndash;1593)
speaks of the "snow white porcelain of Hsüan Chou."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
The <em>T´ao lu</em> enumerates factories which began in the Ming dynasty
and continued to the nineteenth century, and apparently produced
an inferior type of porcelain, and probably pottery as well.
They were located at Huai&ndash;ch´ing Fu <img src="images/i_201c.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, I&ndash;yang Hsien <img src="images/i_201d.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />,
Têng&ndash;fêng Hsien <img src="images/i_201e.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, and Shan Chou <img src="images/i_201f.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in Honan; at Yi Hsien
<img src="images/i_201g.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> and Tsou Hsien <img src="images/i_201h.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in Yen&ndash;chou Fu in Shantung; in the
Lung Shang <img src="images/i_201i.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> district in Shensi, and at Hêng&ndash;fêng <img src="images/i_201j.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in
Kiangsi. The last&ndash;mentioned factory was established by a man
named Ch´ü Chih&ndash;kao from Ch´u&ndash;chou Fu in the early Ming period.
In the Chia Ching period (1522&ndash;1566) it was transferred to the
I&ndash;yang <img src="images/i_201k.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> district to a place called Ma&ndash;k´êng, not many miles
south of Ching&ndash;tê Chên. Both the Lung&ndash;shang and Ma&ndash;k´êng
wares are described as very coarse.</p>

<p>The value of pottery for architectural purposes was recognised
in China from the earliest times. Unglazed bricks and tiles of
Han and pre&ndash;Han periods are preserved by Chinese collectors,
particularly when they happen, as is often the case, to have inscriptions
in old seal characters, or other ornament. The familiar
Chinese roof tile is a long convex object like a horizontal section
of a tube, and those intended for the border are ornamented at
one end with a disc, usually stamped with a dragon or other design
in sunk relief. Here and there, on the apex of the roof or at the
corners, are ornamental tiles carrying figures of deities, heroes,
mythical creatures or birds, modelled in the round and usually
with great force and skill. Besides these, architectural mouldings
and antefixal ornaments in pottery are commonly used on temples
and pavilions of an ornamental kind.</p>

<p>The use of tiles&mdash;and, no doubt, of other architectural embellishments
in pottery&mdash;was encouraged by government enactments at
various times. In the T´ang dynasty (618&ndash;906 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>),<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> in the districts
south and west of the Yangtze, under the inspectorship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a man named Tan <img src="images/i_202a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, the inhabitants were ordered to use tiles
on their houses in place of wood in order to lessen the risk of fire;
kilns were erected to provide the tiles, and those who were too
poor to carry out the alterations by themselves received State
help. A somewhat similar but more important edict was issued
in the twenty&ndash;seventh year of Hung Wu<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> (1394), that bricks and
tiles should be used in all the buildings in the capital, which was
then Nanking, and that kilns should be set up every year on the
<em>Chü&ndash;pao shan</em> for their manufacture. It was not long after this
that the famous "porcelain pagoda" was erected at Nanking,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
the lower part of which was faced with white porcelain bricks,
the remaining storeys with pottery with coloured glazes.</p>

<p>Tile factories existed in all parts of China to supply local needs,
and the few singled out for mention in the <em>T´u Shu</em><a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> were perhaps
of more than usual importance in the Ming dynasty. They are
Lin&ndash;ch´ing <img src="images/i_202b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> in the extreme west of Shantung; Su Chou <img src="images/i_202c.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />
in Kiangsu, on the east side of the lake T´ai&ndash;hu, and facing the
potteries of Yi&ndash;hsing, which supplied tiles for the palaces and temples
of Nanking; the neighbouring Ch´ang&ndash;chou Chên, and Yi&ndash;chên
and Kua Chou in the Yang&ndash;chou Fu of the same province; Wu&ndash;Ch´ing
Hsien <img src="images/i_202d.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />, in the district of Peking, where the potters
asked for permission to make tiles for public use in 1574.</p>

<p>The tile works at Liu&ndash;li&ndash;chü (mentioned on p. <a href="#Page_200">200</a>) date from
the Yüan dynasty. They are also situated in the neighbourhood
of Peking, but whether in the Wu&ndash;ch´ing Hsien or not, I have failed
to discover.</p>

<p>When Peking became the capital of the Ch´ing emperors, no
doubt the tile factories at Wu&ndash;ch´ing Hsien assumed still greater
importance; and according to the catalogue of the exhibition
in Paris in 1878,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> the neighbourhood of Amoy was then celebrated
for its bricks and tiles. This branch of the potter's industry is
represented by a small collection of bricks, tiles, mouldings, and
antefixal ornaments in the British Museum. It includes unglazed
bricks from the Great Wall of China, which may date from 220 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>,
a few Han bricks and tile&ndash;ends with moulded ornament; white
porcelain bricks and coloured pottery tiles and mouldings from
the Nanking pagoda; and tiles from the Ming tombs near Nanking,
which were built in 1400 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>, and like the pagoda destroyed in the
T´aip´ing rebellion in 1853. The Nanking tiles and mouldings are
of hard buff pottery with translucent glazes of green and yellow
colour, minutely crackled, additional colours being formed with
red and creamy white slips. The tile&ndash;ends are ornamented with
dragon medallions.</p>

<p>Other architectural pottery in the same collection came from
the Imperial pleasure grounds at Peking, which were wrecked in
1860. These include tiles and antefixal ornaments from the pavilions
and temples in the Yüan Ming Yüan and from the Summer Palace,
and a few blue&ndash;glazed tiles from the Temple of Heaven. Numerous
tiles with relief figures and pottery figures from niches were picked
up in the ruins of the temples and pavilions in the Imperial grounds
after their capture in 1860; and many of the mouldings were found
to display strong European influences, due, no doubt, to the designs
of the Jesuits Attiret and Castiglione, who assisted the Emperor
Ch´ien Lung in erecting some of the buildings. Some of these
are in the British Museum besides antefixes in the form of yellow
dragon heads from the Winter Palace at Peking and from the celebrated
Temple of Kin&ndash;shan, or Golden Island, in the Yangtze;
and a tile from the Huang&ndash;ssŭ, the Great Lama temple, built by
K´ang Hsi in 1647. The tile in question is evidently part of a
restoration, for it bears the date corresponding to 1770.</p>

<p>The ordinary tiles and mouldings are not likely to be extensively
collected by private individuals, but many of the ridge tiles, with
figures of deities, horsemen, lions, <em>ch´i&ndash;lin</em>, and phœnixes, have
found their way into collections to which their spirited modelling
has served as a passport. The glazes on these are often richly
coloured, and include yellow, green, violet purple, aubergine and
purplish black, and occasionally high&ndash;fired glazes with <em>flambé</em> or
variegated colours. By accident or design, the figures are not
infrequently detached from their tiles and mounted on wooden
stands. The pottery figures from niches in the walls of temples
and public buildings are often finely modelled and richly glazed,
and, needless to say, they find a welcome in Western collections
(Plate 58).</p>

<p>It is a common but illogical practice to assign all these figures
in architectural pottery to the Ming dynasty; illogical, because so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
many of them have been brought from the Imperial buildings at
Peking which are known to have been mostly erected in the K´ang
Hsi and Ch´ien Lung period. On the other hand, nothing is more
difficult to date than this type of glazed pottery, in which the ware,
the colours, and the decorative traditions seem to have continued
almost unchanged from the early Ming times to the present day.
The tiles from the Nanking pagoda and from the eighteenth&ndash;century
buildings at Peking are practically interchangeable.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that the potters who made the architectural
pottery often turned their hands and materials to the manufacture
of vases and figures and other ceramic ornaments for domestic use,
and even imposing altar sets for the temples. An important example
of this work is seen in Fig. 2 of Plate 55, a large incense vase<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> of
traditional form (from an altar set) with bowl&ndash;shaped body, wide
mouth, two upstanding handles, and three feet with lion masks. It
is ornamented with a peony scroll and two dragons in high relief,
and is made of pottery with a dull turquoise green glaze. An inscription
on the handles proclaims the fact that it was "dedicated
by the chieftain Kuo Hsin&ndash;shê; made in the eighth year of Chia
Ching," i.e. 1529. In more recent times the tile works near Peking
have turned their attention to the manufacture of vases and bowls
with rich soft monochrome glazes, yellow, green, turquoise and
aubergine in the manner of the similarly coloured porcelains which
are highly prized, and, as Bushell tells us, "the soft excipient (i.e.
the pottery body) seems to impart an added softness" to the glazes.
"The fact that yellow clay," he continues, "used often to be
mixed with the porcelain earth in the old fabrics to enhance the
brilliancy of the glaze colours, gives a certain vraisemblance to the
fraudulent reproductions which I have seen sold for as many dollars
as they would cost in cents to produce." It is unlikely that the
issue of these by&ndash;products of the tile factories is confined to the
neighbourhood of Peking. Among the miscellaneous potteries I
should add that Ka&ndash;shan,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> in Chekiang, is reputed to have been
noted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for a fine porcellanous
stoneware with opaque, camellia&ndash;leaf green glaze minutely
crackled.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="p6">MARKS ON CHINESE POTTERY AND PORCELAIN</p>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE custom of placing on works of art the name of the maker,
the date of manufacture, or some sign or symbol indicating
the intention with which they were made, dates back in China
at least as far as the Han dynasty. Such marks occur on pottery
and porcelain rarely at first, but with a frequency which increases
in proportion as we draw nearer to modern times. They are incised
or stamped in the soft body of the ware, or painted under
the glaze (usually in blue) or over it in enamel colours or gold;
and they are generally placed on the base of the ware, though there
are fairly numerous instances in which the mark is written along
the mouth rim or in some other more or less conspicuous position.</p>

<p>The earliest marks, as far as I am aware, are incised, and those
on the Han, T´ang, and Sung potteries, not to mention the intermediate
dynasties, should be scrutinised with the greatest care to
make sure whether the incisions were made before the pottery was
baked or afterwards. There should be no difficulty in determining
this point, for the lines cut with a sharp instrument in the fired
ware are necessarily harder and less free than those incised in the
soft clay, and the edges of the incisions will present obvious differences
in the two cases. Unfortunately the early date&ndash;marks which I have
seen up to the present have almost all been cut after the firing.
It does not necessarily follow that such inscriptions are modern
additions. Indeed in many cases they are in a style which is clearly
old. But their value as evidence is very small, for it is impossible
to prove the exact time of their carving; and at best we can only
regard them as representing the opinion of some former owner
as to the date of the vessel in question. At their worst, they are
deliberate frauds added by modern vendors with intent to deceive.</p>

<p>Incised or stamped marks have always been common on pottery,
but porcelain is usually marked by painting with a brush, and for
this purpose underglaze blue is the commonest medium, red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
other on&ndash;glaze colours being used chiefly on the relatively modern
wares decorated in <em>famille rose</em> enamels. Similarly the ordinary
script is usual in marks, and seal characters are quite exceptional
on porcelain earlier than the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>It is not safe to take the older date&ndash;marks on porcelain at their
face value. The Chinese with their proverbial veneration for
antiquity habitually placed the date&ndash;marks of the classical reigns
on their porcelain whether decorated in the style of the period
mentioned or not. Already in the sixteenth century the Hsüan
Tê and Ch'êng Hua marks were used in this way, and in the K'ang
Hsi period the names of these two classic reigns were used more
frequently than that of the K'ang Hsi period itself. In fact the
Hsüan Tê and Ch'êng Hua are on the whole the most familiar
marks of all, though the actual wares of these two periods are
among the rarest. The date&ndash;marks of the other Ming Emperors
are less frequently plagiarised, except upon the deliberate imitations
of the wares of the time, such as those made at the Imperial
factory in the Yung Chêng period, which we may be sure were
carefully marked with the appropriate <em>nien hao</em>. Moreover, the
Japanese, who have expended much ingenuity on reproducing Ming
wares, have made free with Ming date&ndash;marks, especially those of
Chia Ching and Wan Li.</p>

<p>In the year 1677 the potters at Ching&ndash;tê Chên were forbidden by
an order of the district prefect<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> to inscribe the period&ndash;name of the
Emperor or any sacred writing on their porcelain, lest the names
should be profaned in the breaking of the ware. It is certain that
this prohibition was not effective for long; but probably the current
date&ndash;mark was suppressed for a time at least, and it is quite likely
that we should trace to this interval the custom of putting symbols
or conventional marks inside the double ring which was usually
occupied by the <em>nien hao</em>, a common practice in the K'ang Hsi period.
In many cases, too, the rings were left empty; but it is a mistake
to regard this as an infallible sign of K'ang Hsi manufacture, for
it is a thing which might happen at any time through negligence,
the rings being made by one person and the marks written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
another. There are, besides, well authenticated instances of the
empty double ring on Wan Li porcelain,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and on post K'ang Hsi
wares. It was, however, such a frequent occurrence on the K'ang
Hsi wares that the modern imitators make a common practice of
leaving the rings blank on their copies of the K'ang Hsi blue and
white. It is not clear whether the prefect's prohibition applied to
the names of Ming emperors, but probably it did not, as it is unlikely
that the adherents of the reigning dynasty would be sensitive
about the titles of the house which they had exterminated. In
any case, Ming marks, especially those of the fifteenth century,
are very common on the K'ang Hsi porcelain, and the K'ang Hsi
mark itself is comparatively rare except on the specimens which
must belong to the later years of the reign.</p>

<p><em>En revanche</em>, the K'ang Hsi mark is freely used on quite modern
wares, that period being now regarded as classical; so that we are
confronted with the paradox that if a specimen of fine quality<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
is marked Ch'êng Hua, it may generally be assumed that it was made
in the K'ang Hsi period, while the bulk of the pieces which bear
the K'ang Hsi mark are of modern date.</p>

<p>The Yung Chêng and Ch'ien Lung porcelains are highly esteemed
to&ndash;day, and consequently the marks of these periods are considered
worthy of a place on modern imitations; but on the whole the bulk
of the specimens bearing these marks will be found to belong to
the period indicated, and the imitations are generally so coarse
as to be unmistakable. The temptation to borrow the reign marks
of the subsequent periods is so slight that we may safely accept
the later marks as correct indications of date.</p>

<p>Marks written in enamel colours and even in gold become increasingly
common on the <em>famille rose</em> porcelains from the Yung
Chêng period onwards, the red mark being more familiar on the
modern wares than the blue; and seal characters frequently replace
the ordinary script in the reign marks of the Yung Chêng and subsequent
periods. Date marks in seal form before the eighteenth
century are very unusual, and should be regarded with suspicion.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing notes that Chinese date marks
must be treated with great caution. In fact it is safer to regard
them merely as secondary evidence, first basing one's judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
on the paste and glaze, the style of decoration and the quality of the
colours. The one exception to this declaration of unfaith is the
marks on the Imperial porcelain. These would naturally be correct
and reliable, except where deliberate imitations of the older wares
were undertaken; and then, no doubt, the mark of the period
imitated would be used to make the illusion complete. The Imperial
marks were the work of calligraphers who were selected for the
purpose, and the writing is careful and in good style. In fact a well&ndash;written
mark is almost as certain a sign of Imperial ware as the
five&ndash;clawed dragon itself.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>At the private factories the marks were often carelessly, even
illegibly, written, and probably little trouble was taken with this
part of the decoration except on the choicer specimens. On a
large proportion of the private wares the mark was omitted altogether.</p>

<p>The marks on Chinese pottery and porcelain may be conveniently
grouped under the following headings:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) Date marks.</p>

<p>(2) Hall marks.</p>

<p>(3) Potters' names and factory marks.</p>

<p>(4) Marks of dedication, felicitation, commendation, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>(1) <em>Date marks.</em></p>

<p>The date marks conform to the two Chinese systems of chronology,
(<em>a</em>) the cyclical and (<em>b</em>) the reign names of the Emperors.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The system by which the years are divided into cycles of
sixty, each year of the cycle having a name, carries back Chinese
chronology to the year 2637 <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>, from which the first cycle is dated.
We are at present in the 76th cycle.</p>

<p>The year names are composed of two characters, the first being
one of the Ten Stems, and the second one of the Twelve Branches;
and as the stems and the branches are taken in strict rotation, it is
clear that the combinations will not be exhausted until sixty have
been formed, that number being the least common multiple of ten
and twelve.</p>

<p>The Ten Stems <span id="i_210a" style="max-width: 3em;"> <img src="images/i_210a.jpg" alt="" /></span> <em>Shih kan</em> are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be seen that cyclical dates without any indication of the
particular cycle intended are merely tantalising. On the other
hand when the reign is specified as well, the combination gives the
most precise form of date. But unfortunately there are many cases
in which the reign name is absent, and we can only judge the cycle
by the style of the ware, a calculation which is always open to
dispute. It is not often that the cycle is so clearly indicated by an
indirect method as in the oft&ndash;quoted mark <em>yu hsin ch´ou nien chih</em>
<span class="figcenter" id="i_213a" style="max-width: 5.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_213a.jpg" alt="" />
</span> = made in the <em>hsin ch´ou</em> year recurring (<em>yu</em>).This can
only be 1721, when the <em>hsin ch´ou</em> year actually recurred in the
(sixty&ndash;first year of) reign of K´ang Hsi.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The more usual form of date mark is that which gives the
reign name of an Emperor. On ascending the throne the Emperor
discarded his family name and assumed a title by which his reign
was thenceforth known. This is the name which appears in the
date marks, and it is known as the <em>nien</em> (period) <em>hao</em> (name). After
his death the Emperor received another title, the <em>miao hao</em>, or name
under which he was canonised; but though reference might be made
to him in history under his <em>miao hao</em>, it is obvious that the posthumous
name cannot occur on contemporary date marks.</p>

<p>In reckoning the date of an Emperor's reign it was not usual to include
officially the year in which his predecessor had died, but to date
the reign from the first day of the year following. Thus, though K´ang
Hsi became Emperor in 1661, his reign is dated officially from 1662.</p>

<p>The Imperial date mark is usually written in six characters
beginning with the name of the dynasty and ending with the words
<em>nien chih</em> (made in the period): the <em>nien hao</em> coming in the middle:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span> 2<span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>  3<span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span>  4<span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span> 5<span class="mleft3">&nbsp;</span> 6<br />
e.g. <span class="mleft1">&nbsp;</span> <em>Ta</em><span class="mleft2">&nbsp;</span> <em>ming</em><span class="mleft2">&nbsp;</span> <em>ch´êng</em><span class="mleft1">&nbsp;</span><em>hua</em><span class="mleft2a">&nbsp;</span> <em>nien</em><span class="mleft1c">&nbsp;</span> <em>chih</em> = made (<em>chih</em>)</p>

<p>4 <img src="images/i_213b.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<p>in the Ch´êng Hua period (<em>nien</em>) of the great Ming (dynasty).</p>

<p>Occasionally the word <em>nien</em> is replaced by <em>yü</em> <img src="images/i_213c.jpg" alt="" /> (Imperial),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<em>yü chih</em> meaning made by Imperial command; and in place of <em>chih</em>
we sometimes find the word <em>tsao</em> <img src="images/i_214g.jpg" alt="" /> or more rarely <em>tso</em> <img src="images/i_214h.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> both of which
have the same meaning "made."</p>

<p>The six characters may be written in two lines of three, or in
three lines of two, or again in one long line read from right to left;
and for reasons of space, and sometimes for no apparent reason,
the first two characters are omitted, e.g. <span class="dropping"><img src="images/i_214i.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /></span>. The omission of the
<em>nien hao</em> is rare except on a few Japanese copies of Chinese porcelain,
e.g. <span class="dropping"><img src="images/i_214j.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /></span> <em>ta ming nien chih</em> = made in the great Ming dynasty.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the seal forms of the mark were frequently
employed from the eighteenth century onwards (see p. <a href="#Page_209">209</a>). An
archaic form of seal character occurs in the Yung Lo mark which is
given below.</p>

<p>The use of the <em>nien hao</em> on the Imperial wares made at Ching&ndash;tê
Chên was made obligatory by a command issued in the Ching&ndash;tê
period (1004&ndash;1007), when the name of the town was altered to
Ching&ndash;tê Chên.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Hall marks.</em></p>

<p>The "hall mark," which is of frequent occurrence on both
porcelain and pottery, is so called because it includes the word
<em>t´ang</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_217e.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (hall) or some equivalent such as <em>chai</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_217f.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (a study), <em>t´ing</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_217g.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />
(a pavilion), <em>hsien</em> or <em>hsüan</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_217h.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (a porch, balcony or pavilion), <em>kuan</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_217i.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (a residence or hostelry), <em>fang</em>
<img class="w100" src="images/i_217j.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (a room or house), <em>chü</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_217k.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (a
dwelling). The word <em>t´ang</em> as explained in Giles's Dictionary is
"a hall: especially a hall of justice or court; the ancestral hall;
an official title." <em>T´ang ming</em> is "the family hall name&mdash;a fancy
name usually consisting of two characters followed by <em>t´ang</em> (e.g.
<em>wu tê t´ang chin</em> = Chin of the military valour hall), and referring
to some event in family history. It is generally inscribed in one of
the principal rooms of the house, and is used in deeds, on graves,
boundary stones, etc."</p>

<p>The hall mark, then, may contain the studio name of the maker
or of the recipient of the ware, or it may have reference literally to
the building for which the ware was intended. The last interpretation
can be generally applied to the marks referring to halls or pavilions
in the precincts of the Imperial palace. Again, the hall may be the
shop of a dealer who ordered the goods. But in the absence of prepositions,
it is not always&mdash;not often, I should perhaps say&mdash;possible
to determine which of these alternatives is implied in any particular
hallmark; e.g. <img class="w100" src="images/i_217aa.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="" /> <em>Lin yü t´ang chih</em> may mean "made in the
Abundant&ndash;Jade Hall," or "for" the same, or by a man whose
studio name was <em>Lin&ndash;yü t´ang</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the antiquity of hall marks, it was not considered anachronistic
to cut one on a Han granary urn which is now in the British
Museum; but unfortunately as the cutting was done after the ware
was baked it is now impossible to say at what period it was executed.
A Sung example is quoted in the <em>Ni ku lu</em> (written in the middle of
the sixteenth century) as inscribed on a Ting Chou vase in the
handwriting of the Mi family, viz., <em>jên ho kuan</em> <img class="w100" src="images/i_218a.jpg" alt="" /> (Hotel of
Benevolence and Harmony). A similar mark similarly placed is
 <img class="w100" src="images/i_218b.jpg" alt="" /><em>jên ts´un t´ang</em> (Hall of Benevolence), on a Tz´ŭ Chou jar
in the Eumorfopoulos Collection.</p>

<p>Hall marks on Ming porcelain are rare. There is, however, one
which occurs fairly often on late Ming porcelains of various
kinds, including pieces decorated in blue and blue and white,
underglaze red, blue and enamel colours, pierced designs and slip.
This is  <img class="w100" src="images/i_218c.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="" /> <em>yü t´ang chia ch´i</em>, "beautiful vessel for the Jade Hall."</p>

<p>It is improbable that the <em>yü t´ang</em> was a factory name, as the
specimens so marked have little homogeneity. Giles's Dictionary tells
us that <em>yü t´ang</em> is a name for the Han Lin College at Peking, which
was so called in memory of Chou Chih&ndash;lin of the Sung dynasty, upon
whom the Emperor bestowed these two characters in admiration of
his qualities. From this we might infer that the wares so marked
were made for the Han Lin; but why, one asks, in that case should
the examples in our collections be so many and so evidently of the
same period? On the whole I prefer to regard the mark as of
general (and complimentary) significance, i.e. "beautiful vessel for
the home of pure worth," like another mark much affected on
late Ming porcelain <em>fu kuei chia ch´i</em> ("fine vessel for the rich and
honourable!").</p>

<p>Hall marks are very frequent on the porcelains of the Ch´ing
dynasty, and enough are given below to illustrate their various
forms. Many of them are no doubt hall names of makers
and decorators, and as such belong to the category of artists'
signatures.</p>

<p>Special interest attaches to those hall marks which have been
identified as referring to pavilions in the precincts of the Imperial
palace. We are told by Bushell<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> that the "fashion of inscribing
upon porcelain made for the Imperial palace the name of the particular
pavilion for which it was intended seems to have begun in the reign
of Yung Chêng," and observation shows that these hall marks only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
become frequent on the later porcelains. In fact most of the examples
with which I am acquainted are nearer in style to the Tao
Kuang than to the Yung Chêng wares, and the majority of the hall
marks written in red on the glaze will be found to be of early
nineteenth century date.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Potters' names, etc.</em></p>

<p>Marks which include potters' names (apart from the uncertain
hall marks) are rare on Chinese porcelain though frequent enough
on pottery. But it will be remembered that at Ching&ndash;tê Chên at
any rate the porcelain passed through so many hands that the individuality
of the work was lost, and consequently a personal mark
would be, as a rule, misleading. The question of signatures in the
field of the decoration has been discussed<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> with the conclusion that
they belong rather to the artists who painted the original copied
by the pot&ndash;painters than to the pot&ndash;painter himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should include here a fairly common type of mark,
usually in the form of a small seal of a conventional and quite illegible
character, which goes by the name of "shop marks." But it is not
clear whether they refer to the maker or the firm who ordered the
porcelain.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Marks of dedication, felicitation</em>, etc.</p>

<p>In many cases the place of a date mark, hall mark, or potter's
name is taken by a word or phrase commending or describing the ware
or invoking a benediction on the possessor. Such marks may be conveniently
subdivided into marks of (<em>a</em>) dedication, (<em>b</em>) felicitation,
(<em>c</em>) commendation; to which may be added (<em>d</em>) symbols used as marks.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Marks of dedication</em> indicating the destination or intention
of the ware contain the name of a place or person or some word
suggesting the use to which the vessel was dedicated. This group
naturally overlaps that of the hall marks, there being no essential
difference between a palace hall mark and such a mark as <em>Shu fu</em>
<img class="w100" src="images/i_224a.jpg" alt="" /> (Imperial palace) which was inscribed on the Imperial
porcelain of the Yüan dynasty.</p>

<p>A few marks of dedication are mentioned in the <em>Po wu yao lan</em><a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
e.g. <img class="w100" src="images/i_224b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>t´an</em> (altar) on the altar cups of the Hsüan Tê period; <img class="w100" src="images/i_224c.jpg" alt="" />
<em>ch´a</em> (tea), <img class="w100" src="images/i_224d.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>chiu</em> (wine), <img class="w100" src="images/i_224e.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />
<em>tsao t´ang</em> (decoction of jujubes), and <img class="w100" src="images/i_224f.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>chiang t´ang</em> (decoction of ginger), which were inscribed inside
the altar cups of the Chia Ching period, besides <img class="w100" src="images/i_224g.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>chin lu</em> (golden
seal), <img class="w100" src="images/i_224h.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> <em>ta chiao</em> (great sacrifice), and <img class="w100" src="images/i_224i.jpg" alt="Chinese character" />
<em>t´an yung</em> (altar use), which were written beneath them; all indicating the offerings
and the altars for which the cups were destined.</p>

<p>Dedications to temples, institutions, and even to individuals,
often of considerable length, also occur not infrequently.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Marks of felicitation</em> include good wishes such as <em>ch´ang
ming fu kuei</em> (long life, riches and honour), <em>wan fu yu t´ung</em> (may
infinite happiness embrace all your affairs), both of which have been
noted on Ming porcelain; words of good omen such as <em>fu</em>, <em>lu</em>, <em>shou</em>,
separately or together, <img class="w100" src="images/i_224j.jpg" alt="" /> <em>chi</em> (good luck),
<img class="w100" src="images/i_224k.jpg" alt="" /> <em>ch´ing</em> (prosperity), etc.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Marks of commendation</em> are also frequent, especially in the
K´ang Hsi period and on blue and white porcelain. They allude to
the beauty of the ware, comparing it with jade or gold or gems, or
to the subject of the decoration; and they vary in length from a
single character such as <img class="w100" src="images/i_224l.jpg" alt="" /> <em>yü</em> (jade) to a sentence like <em>ch´i shih
pao ting chih chên</em> (a gem among precious vessels of rare stone).</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) A sacred symbol or emblematic ornament often replaces the
mark on K´ang Hsi porcelain; but as these will be found among the
symbols, etc., described in vol. ii., ch. xvii., there is no need to
discuss them any further. The most frequently used are the <em>pa
pao</em> (Eight Precious Things), and the <em>pa chi hsiang</em> (the Eight
Buddhist Emblems of Happy Augury).</p>

Chi&ndash;ning Chou, in Shantung, would go far to prove the existence of a highly sophisticated
glazed pottery at a date not less than 500 years <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span> The find is described
and illustrated in the <em>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</em>, Jahrg. 43, 1911, p. 153, by Herr Ernst
Börschmann. The vase, which is 10 cm. high, is of globular form, with a short
straight neck and two loop handles. It is of hard buff ware, with a chocolate brown
glaze with purplish reflexions of a metallic appearance, and the glaze covers only the
upper part of the exterior and ends in an uneven line with drops. One would say
Sung or possibly T'ang, and of the type associated with the name Chien yao. This
pot was found not in a tomb, but in the undisturbed earth at a depth of seven metres,
by a German architect, while sinking a well; and a reasoned case from the stratification
of the soil is made out to prove that it must have at least an antiquity of twenty&ndash;four
hundred years. It is, however, proverbial that geological arguments applied to
relatively modern archæology lead to results more startling than correct; and I refuse
to accept this solitary specimen as evidence to upset the whole theory of the evolution
of Chinese pottery. For it must do nothing less. This piece is of a style which
is at present unknown before the T'ang dynasty. It has nothing in common with
Han pottery as we know it, still less with Chou, and to accept its Chou date would be
to believe that an advanced style of manufacture was in use 500 years <span class="smcapa">B. C.</span>, that it
was forgotten again for some twelve centuries, and then reappeared in precisely the
same form. Fukien white porcelain seals have been found in an Irish bog in positions
from which geologists might infer a colossal antiquity, but the history of porcelain
has not been disturbed on that account; and I cannot help thinking that this strange
phenomenon at Chi&ndash;ning Chou must be regarded in much the same light.</p></div>

in the <em>Neue Rundschau</em> (Oct., 1913, p. 1427) by F. Perzynski, entitled <em>Jagd auf Götter</em>.
Mr. Perzynski describes his hazardous journey to an almost inaccessible cave temple
on a mountain top near Ichou in Chihli, and there is little doubt that this is the place
from which our wonderful figure came. He speaks of the hill as the Acthlohanberg,
implying a tradition of eight of these figures of Lohan, which had apparently been
concealed in this and other caverns for safety during a period of iconoclasm, such as
occurred in the ninth and the thirteenth centuries, when thousands of Buddhist shrines
were wrecked. He found the shrine bare of the Lohan, except for a few fragments.
The rest had been pillaged, and several of the figures had evidently been broken in
the attempt to remove them through the narrow aperture of the caves, or to conceal
them afterwards. Parts of them, and a sadly damaged Lohan, were actually shown
to him in the neighbourhood; and he afterwards succeeded in obtaining a complete
figure and a torso, which were exhibited by him in Berlin. On the altar of the shrine
he found an incense burner of glazed ware, which he attributed to the Yüan dynasty,
and there was a tablet recording the restoration of the altar in the reign of Chêng Tê
(early sixteenth century). It is interesting to note that Mr. Perzynski assumed at once
that these figures are of T´ang date. Incidentally, he mentions a visit to a hill which
he calls the Kuanyinberg, where a cavern temple exists containing the remains of a
colossal statue of Kuanyin. It is now broken, but Mr. Perzynski saw it standing in its
enormous stature of three metres high, to which must be added a stand a metre high
and two in width. This figure was originally in glazed pottery, possibly also of the
T´ang period, but a great part of it had been restored in wood and plaster in the seventeenth
century.</p></div>

lustrous reflections in the glaze of some of the Yüeh wares. It runs, "Yüeh yao cups

<img src="images/i_068b.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> <em>mi sê fên ch´ing</em>. <em>Mi sê</em> is rendered in Giles's Dictionary, "Straw
colour, the colour of yellow millet," and all Chinese authorities whom I have questioned
agree that it is a yellow colour. Bushell in much of his published work rendered it
"rice coloured," following Julien's <em>couleur du riz</em>, and others, including myself, have
been misled by this rendering. Bushell, however, in a note in Monkhouse's <em>Chinese
Porcelain</em>, p. 67, which is quoted at length in vol. ii., p. 220, pronounces in favour
of the rendering yellow. The difficulty of finding a true yellow among the Sung wares
to support the comparison with yellow millet has further complicated the question.
The vase in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is figured in Monkhouse (fig. 22)
as a specimen of old <em>mi sê</em>, is probably a Yung Chêng reproduction of the Sung type.
It has a stone&ndash;coloured crackle glaze, overlaid with a brownish yellow enamel, a technique
which is foreign to the Sung wares. Possibly one type of Sung <em>mi sê</em> was illustrated
by the "shallow bowl with spout, of grey stoneware with opaque glaze of pale sulphur
yellow," which Mr. Alexander exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1910
(Cat. K. 18). Another kind is described by Bushell in the catalogue of the Morgan
collection (p. 38) as follows: "Shallow bowl (<em>wan</em>). Greenish yellow crackled glaze
of the Sung dynasty, leaving a bare ring at the bottom within. A specimen of ancient
<em>mi sê</em> or millet&ndash;coloured crackle from the Kiang&ndash;hsi potteries. Formerly the possession
of His Excellency Chang Yinhuan. D. 6 inches." Specimens of this type, with
greenish and brownish yellow crackle glaze, have been found in Borneo, where they
have been reputed to be of enormous age; there are several examples in the British
Museum. The Hirth collection in the Gotha Museum includes four high&ndash;footed
bowls of brownish yellow colour which seem to belong to this class.</p></div>

waste place called Hsiang&ndash;hu <img src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />, where there were formerly the foundations of

waste pieces. The material was very thin, and the ware was evidently millet&ndash;coloured
(<em>mi sê</em>) and pale green (<em>fên ch´ing</em>)." The memoir of Chiang (1322) states that "the

literally "kingfisher feathers in layers," a metaphor from the well&ndash;known jewellery

"Of these wares, the sword&ndash;grass bowls and their saucers alone are refined. The other
kinds, like the garden seats, boxes, square vases, and flower jars, are all of yellow sandy
earthenware. Consequently, they are coarse and thick, and not refined." The first
sentence is difficult, and has given rise to much discussion. The word <em>ti</em>, which Bushell
has (rightly, I think) rendered saucers, literally means "bottom" or "base." Hirth
reads it, "Those which have bottoms like the flower pots in which sword&ndash;grass is grown
are considered the most excellent"; and Julien appears to have quite misunderstood
the application of the passage. The original is <img src="images/i_110.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />. The shallow
saucers in which the deep flower pots stood are often included among the bulb
bowls. See Plates 37 and 40.</p></div>

was at first, at any rate, an accidental effect; but it is the prototype of the "dragon
skin" glazes which the Japanese made at a later date. There is a good example in
the Eumorfopoulos Collection of a bowl with thick grey Chün glaze, with a patch of
reddish colour, and which is shrivelled in the most approved fashion, the glaze contracting
into isolated drops and exposing the body between them.</p></div>

case of the former (<em>t´u ssŭ wên</em>) some confusion has been caused by a variant reading
<img src="images/i_113a.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> of the word <img src="images/i_113b.jpg" alt="Chinese character" /> (<em>t´u</em> = hare), which refers the simile to the "dodder"; but the commoner
phrase, "hare's fur marking," is far more descriptive of a dappled surface.
Brinkley's explanation of the second phrase, <em>huo yen ch´ing</em>, as referring to the blue
centre of a tongue of flame, applying the simile to the passages of blue which sometimes
occur in the variegated Chün glazes, seems to meet the case. The flame&ndash;like effects
are mentioned in an interesting passage in the <em>T´ang chien kung t´ao yeh t´u shuo</em> (quoted
in the <em>T´ao lu</em>, bk. viii., fol. 13): "Men prize the Chün cups, tripods, and incense
burners with smoke and flame glaze (<em>yen huan sê</em>). Although only pottery, still they
combine the unexpected colours produced by the blowing tube (<em>t´o yo</em>)." The <em>t´o yo</em>
<img src="images/i_113c.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> seems to have been "a pipe for blowing up the furnace."</p></div>

statement that the district of Ching&ndash;tê Chên sent regular supplies of its ware, which he
terms porcelain, to the Emperor from the second year of the reign of <em>Tam ou te</em> (sic).
Though he gives the date as 422, it is clear that he really refers to the first Emperor,
Wu Tê, of the T´ang dynasty (618&ndash;627 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>). It is not clear how he arrived at the
conclusion that the ware in question was porcelain, and as he refers to the Annals of
Fou&ndash;liang as his authority, we may assume that the Chinese phrase contained the
inconclusive term <em>tz´ŭ</em>. or <em>t´ao</em>. He adds that "nothing is said as to the inventor, nor
to what experiments or accident the invention was due."</p></div>

all varieties of pottery which are made translucent by adding to the clay substances
some natural or artificial fluxing material." In China the usual constituents are
<em>kaolin</em>, which forms the clay substance, and <em>petuntse</em> (china stone), which is the natural
fluxing material. I should add that it is doubtful whether we are strictly justified in
using the word <em>kaolin</em> as a general name for porcelain earth (<em>o t´u</em>); but the term has
been consecrated by usage, and has practically passed into our language in this sense.
A slight translucency is observable near the rim on a white T´ang cup in the Eumorfopoulos
Collection. The body of this piece is a soft white material, and the translucency
is caused by a mingling of the glaze with the body where it is very thin, and it may
be compared with the translucency of the Persian "gombroon" ware. But neither of
these wares can be ranked as porcelain proper.</p></div>

this quality in a "brown ware (<em>tz´ŭ</em>) bowl" sent as tribute by the P´o&ndash;hai in 841 <span class="smcapa">A. D.</span>
which is described as "translucent both inside and outside, of a pure brown colour,
half an inch thick but as light as swan's down." The words of the text <img src="images/i_148.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />
<em>nei wai t´ung jung</em> ("inside and out throughout lustrous") are in themselves capable
of suggesting translucence, but the remaining features&mdash;the brown glaze and the great
thickness&mdash;are sufficient to preclude the idea of a translucent ware; and I imagine
that the quality of lustre or translucency here applies only to the glaze. The P´o&ndash;hai
appear to have been a subject state of Corea.</p></div>

finds obtained from ancient sites in the Persian Gulf and now in the British Museum.
But the evidence of these pieces is not conclusive, for the sites were inhabited for many
centuries. That of Samarra, on the other hand, is most important, for the city was
only of a mushroom growth, which began and ended in the ninth century. See also

<img src="images/i_166b.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> in the Chao&ndash;ch´ing Fu in Kuangtung. It is, in fact, an imitation of the
<em>Yang&ndash;tz´ŭ</em> ware. Consequently, the Records of the Province state that the productions
of Yang&ndash;chiang in Kuangtung include 'porcelain wares' (<em>tz´ŭ ch´i</em>). I have seen
incense burners (<em>lu</em>), vases (<em>p´ing</em>), cups (<em>chien</em>), plates (<em>t´ieh</em>), bowls (<em>wan</em>), dishes (<em>p´an</em>),
pots (<em>hu</em>), and boxes (<em>ho</em>) of this manufacture. They are very ornamental and bright,
but in taste, fineness, elegance, and lustre they are not equal to porcelain wares. Nor
have they been able to avoid the occurrence of flaws exposing the body, which are
unsightly. Still they are imitated at T´ang's manufactory, the imitations being admirable
in their elegance and lustre, and excelling the Kuang yao. These, like the Tz´ŭ&ndash;Chou
and Hsü&ndash;Chou types of ware, are none of them made of porcelain clay." The
<em>T´ao chêng chi shih</em> states: "He (i.e. T´ang Ying) imitates singularly well the Kuang
yao glaze, being particularly successful with the spotted blue (<em>ch´ing tien</em> <img src="images/i_166c.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" />)
kind of glaze. Following this author, imitations were also made of the copies produced
at T´ang's factory." The greater part of this passage seems to contain a confusion
of ideas. <em>Yang&ndash;tz´ŭ</em> <img src="images/i_166d.jpg" alt="Chinese characters" /> or "foreign porcelain" was the name given to the
painted Canton enamels which are described on the next page of the <em>T´ao lu</em> under
that heading. The passage beginning "I have seen" and ending "equal to porcelain
wares" is taken almost verbatim from the sections which deal with Canton enamels
and cloisonné enamels. The remark on "imitation of the Yang&ndash;tz´ŭ ware" could by no
stretch of imagination be applied to the mottled Kuang yao; but it does apply to
the large group of porcelain obtained in the white from Ching&ndash;tê Chên and painted
at Canton precisely in the style of the Canton enamels (see vol. ii., p. 243). This is no doubt
what the author had in his mind. The sentence about the unsightly flaws can apply
to either the enamels or the Kuang yao, but more particularly to the latter. For
the rest, "T´ang's factory" is the Imperial factory at Ching&ndash;tê Chên, which was under
the management of the celebrated T´ang Ying between 1728 and 1749.</p></div>

by a man of Yi&ndash;hsing ... who took the name of Ou, and everybody called it Ou's
ware. It included wares which imitated Ko ware in crackle, Kuan and Chün wares
in colour. Ou's bright coloured glazes were very numerous. The wares consist of
flower dishes, stands for boxes, etc. The glazes with red and blue markings are particularly
choice. At Ch´ang&ndash;nan the factory of T´ang used to imitate them." The last
sentence refers to the celebrated T´ang Ying, who supervised the Imperial factory at
Ching&ndash;tê Chên from 1728&ndash;1749. The statement that Tang's factory imitated them is
no doubt based on the oft&ndash;quoted list given in the <em>Chiang hsi t´ung chih</em> of wares made
at the Imperial factory about 1730, which include "glazes of Ou. Imitations of the
old ware of the potter named Ou, including two kinds, that with red and that with

Possibly a portion of this group comes from one of the Canton factories, but it is the
kind of ware which might have been made in any pottery district, and there are quite
modern examples of the same type of glaze and biscuit in the Field Museum of Chicago
which were manufactured at Ma&ndash;chuang, near T´ai&ndash;yüan Fu, in Shensi.</p></div>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
